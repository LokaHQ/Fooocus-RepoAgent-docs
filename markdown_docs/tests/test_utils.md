## ClassDef TestUtils
**TestUtils**: The function of TestUtils is to provide unit tests for parsing tokens related to LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) references in prompts.

**attributes**: The attributes of this Class.
· test_cases: A list of dictionaries containing input prompts, existing LoRA references, limits, and expected outputs for testing the parsing functionality.

**Code Description**: The TestUtils class inherits from unittest.TestCase, which allows it to serve as a test case for unit testing in Python. This class contains two primary test methods: test_can_parse_tokens_with_lora and test_can_parse_tokens_and_strip_performance_lora. 

The method test_can_parse_tokens_with_lora is designed to validate the functionality of parsing LoRA references from a given prompt. It defines a series of test cases, each consisting of an input prompt, a list of existing LoRA references, a limit on the number of LoRA references to parse, and a flag indicating whether to skip file checks. The expected output for each test case is also defined. The method iterates through each test case, calling the util.parse_lora_references_from_prompt function with the provided inputs and asserting that the actual output matches the expected output.

The second method, test_can_parse_tokens_and_strip_performance_lora, focuses on ensuring that performance-related LoRA references are correctly stripped from the list of available LoRA filenames based on the specified performance level. Similar to the first method, it defines a set of test cases with inputs and expected outputs. It utilizes the modules.util.remove_performance_lora function to filter out performance LoRAs before calling the parsing function and asserting the results.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the util module and the modules.flags are correctly implemented and accessible for the tests to run successfully. The test cases should cover various scenarios, including edge cases, to ensure comprehensive testing of the parsing functionality.
### FunctionDef test_can_parse_tokens_with_lora(self)
**test_can_parse_tokens_with_lora**: The function of test_can_parse_tokens_with_lora is to validate the behavior of the parse_lora_references_from_prompt function by running a series of test cases that check its ability to correctly parse and extract LORA references from a given prompt.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· None

**Code Description**: The test_can_parse_tokens_with_lora function is a unit test designed to ensure the correct functionality of the parse_lora_references_from_prompt function. It defines a series of test cases, each consisting of an input prompt, a list of existing LORA references, a limit on the number of LORA references to return, and a flag to skip file existence checks. Each test case specifies the expected output, which includes the correctly parsed LORA references and the cleaned prompt string.

The function iterates over each test case, extracting the input parameters and expected output. It then calls the parse_lora_references_from_prompt function with these parameters and compares the actual output to the expected output using an assertion. If the actual output does not match the expected output, the test will fail, indicating that there is an issue with the parsing logic.

The test cases cover various scenarios, including:
- Basic parsing of LORA references from a prompt.
- Handling of limits on the number of LORA references returned.
- Precedence of LORA references provided in the input list over those in the prompt.
- Correct parsing when LORA references are not separated by spaces.
- Deduplication of LORA references to avoid duplicates in the output.
- Handling of invalid LORA references that do not conform to expected formats.

This function serves as a critical component in the testing suite, ensuring that the parse_lora_references_from_prompt function behaves as expected under different conditions. By validating the output against known expected results, it helps maintain the integrity of the codebase and ensures that future changes do not introduce regressions.

**Note**: It is essential to ensure that the test cases are comprehensive and cover all edge cases to guarantee the robustness of the parsing logic. Additionally, any changes to the parse_lora_references_from_prompt function should be accompanied by updates to the test cases to reflect new functionality or changes in behavior.

### FunctionDef test_can_parse_tokens_and_strip_performance_lora(self)
**test_can_parse_tokens_and_strip_performance_lora**: The function of test_can_parse_tokens_and_strip_performance_lora is to validate the functionality of parsing LORA references from a prompt string while ensuring that performance-related LORA files are appropriately filtered out.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· None

**Code Description**: The test_can_parse_tokens_and_strip_performance_lora function is a unit test designed to verify the behavior of the LORA parsing functionality within the application. It specifically tests the ability to correctly parse LORA references from a given prompt string while stripping out any LORA files associated with specific performance modes.

The function begins by defining a list of LORA filenames, which includes a mix of actual filenames and performance-related identifiers from the PerformanceLoRA enumeration. This setup allows the test to simulate various scenarios where LORA references may be included in the prompt.

Next, the function establishes a series of test cases, each consisting of an input prompt and the expected output. Each test case specifies a prompt string that includes LORA references in the format `<lora:name:weight>`, along with parameters that dictate how the parsing should occur, such as the list of existing LORA files, the limit on the number of LORA references to return, and the performance mode to consider.

The core of the function involves iterating through each test case, where it extracts the input parameters and calls the remove_performance_lora function to filter out any LORA filenames that correspond to the specified performance mode. This ensures that the parsing function only considers valid LORA files that are not associated with the performance settings being tested.

Following this, the function invokes the parse_lora_references_from_prompt function, which is responsible for processing the prompt and extracting valid LORA references. The expected output is then compared to the actual output produced by the parsing function using an assertion. This comparison validates that the parsing logic behaves as intended under various conditions.

The relationship with its callees is significant, as the test relies on the correct implementation of both the remove_performance_lora and parse_lora_references_from_prompt functions. The former ensures that performance-related LORA files are excluded from consideration, while the latter performs the actual parsing of the prompt to extract valid LORA references.

**Note**: It is essential to ensure that the test cases cover a comprehensive range of scenarios, including different performance modes and prompt formats, to thoroughly validate the parsing functionality. Additionally, the test should be executed in an environment where the necessary modules and dependencies are correctly configured to avoid any runtime errors.
