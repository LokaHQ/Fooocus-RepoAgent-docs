## ClassDef TestUtils
**TestUtils**: The function of TestUtils is to provide unit tests for the `try_eval_env_var` function from the `extra_utils` module.

**attributes**: The attributes of this Class.
· test_cases: A list of dictionaries containing input values and their expected outputs for various data types.

**Code Description**: The TestUtils class is a subclass of `unittest.TestCase`, which is part of the Python standard library for writing and running tests. This class specifically contains a single method, `test_try_eval_env_var`, which is designed to validate the behavior of the `try_eval_env_var` function. The method defines a series of test cases, each represented as a dictionary with two keys: "input" and "output". The "input" key holds a tuple containing a string value and the expected type to which the value should be converted. The "output" key holds the expected result after conversion.

The method iterates over each test case, extracting the value and expected type from the "input" key and the expected result from the "output" key. It then calls the `try_eval_env_var` function with the extracted value and expected type, comparing the actual result to the expected result using the `assertEqual` method. This ensures that the function behaves as intended for a variety of input scenarios, including strings representing integers, floats, booleans, lists, dictionaries, and tuples.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the `try_eval_env_var` function is correctly implemented to handle the various types specified in the test cases. The tests will help identify any discrepancies between the expected and actual behavior, facilitating debugging and ensuring code reliability.
### FunctionDef test_try_eval_env_var(self)
**test_try_eval_env_var**: The function of test_try_eval_env_var is to validate the behavior of the try_eval_env_var function through a series of predefined test cases.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· parameter1: None - This function does not take any parameters.

**Code Description**: The test_try_eval_env_var function is a unit test designed to ensure the correct functionality of the try_eval_env_var function from the extra_utils module. It defines a list of test cases, each containing an input value and an expected output. The input consists of a tuple with a string representation of a value and the expected Python type to which the value should be converted.

The function iterates through each test case, extracting the value and expected type. It then calls the try_eval_env_var function with these parameters and compares the actual output to the expected output using an assertion. If the actual output matches the expected output for all test cases, it confirms that the try_eval_env_var function behaves as intended across various scenarios, including different data types such as strings, integers, booleans, lists, dictionaries, and tuples.

The relationship with its callees is significant, as the test_try_eval_env_var function directly tests the core functionality of try_eval_env_var, which is responsible for converting string representations of values into their corresponding Python data types. This testing is crucial for maintaining the reliability of the code, especially in contexts where environment variable values need to be accurately interpreted.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the test cases cover a wide range of possible inputs to thoroughly validate the try_eval_env_var function. Additionally, any changes to the implementation of try_eval_env_var should be accompanied by updates to the test cases to ensure continued accuracy and reliability.
