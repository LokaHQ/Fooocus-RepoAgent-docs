## FunctionDef default_interrogator(image_rgb, threshold, character_threshold, exclude_tags)
**default_interrogator**: The function of default_interrogator is to analyze an RGB image and return a formatted string of relevant tags based on a pre-trained model's inference.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
路 image_rgb: A NumPy array representing the input image in RGB format.
路 threshold: A float value that sets the minimum probability for general tags to be included in the result (default is 0.35).
路 character_threshold: A float value that sets the minimum probability for character tags to be included in the result (default is 0.85).
路 exclude_tags: A string containing tags to be excluded from the final output, separated by commas (default is an empty string).

**Code Description**: The default_interrogator function is designed to perform image analysis using a pre-trained model for tagging images. It begins by loading the model and its associated CSV file containing tag information from specified URLs. The function checks for the existence of a global model and CSV data to avoid redundant downloads, enhancing efficiency.

The input image is resized to maintain the aspect ratio while fitting it into a square format required by the model. The image is then converted from RGB to BGR format, which is the expected input format for the model. The function retrieves the model's output labels and runs inference on the processed image, obtaining probabilities for each tag.

The results are filtered based on the specified thresholds for general and character tags. Tags that meet the probability criteria are collected, and any tags specified in the exclude_tags parameter are removed from the final output. The remaining tags are formatted into a string, with special characters escaped for safe display.

This function is called in two contexts within the project. In the `trigger_describe` function of the webui.py module, it is invoked to generate descriptions for images based on the selected modes (photo or anime). The results from default_interrogator are appended to a list of prompts, which are then combined into a single string for output. This integration allows for dynamic image analysis based on user input.

**Note**: Users should ensure that the input image is in the correct RGB format and that the specified thresholds are appropriate for their use case. Additionally, the function relies on the availability of the model files at the specified URLs, and network issues may affect the loading process.

**Output Example**: An example return value from the function could be a string representing the identified tags, such as "cat, cute, playful".
