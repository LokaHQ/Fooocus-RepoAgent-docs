## ClassDef FaceWarpException
**FaceWarpException**: The function of FaceWarpException is to handle exceptions specifically related to face warping operations.

**attributes**: The attributes of this Class.
· parameter1: message - A string that describes the exception encountered during face warping.

**Code Description**: The FaceWarpException class is a custom exception that inherits from Python's built-in Exception class. It overrides the __str__ method to provide a more informative error message when the exception is raised. The message includes the file name where the exception occurred, along with the default exception message provided by the superclass. This class is utilized in the context of facial image processing, particularly in functions that require precise facial point alignment and image warping.

The FaceWarpException is raised in various scenarios within the functions get_reference_facial_points and warp_and_crop_face. In get_reference_facial_points, it is triggered when the input parameters do not meet the expected conditions, such as when there are no paddings specified while an output size is provided, or when the inner padding factor is outside the valid range. Similarly, in warp_and_crop_face, the exception is raised if the shapes of the facial points and reference points do not match, or if the reference points are not in the expected format. This ensures that any issues related to facial point alignment and image processing are caught and reported clearly, allowing developers to debug and resolve issues effectively.

**Note**: It is essential to handle the FaceWarpException appropriately in any implementation that utilizes the functions get_reference_facial_points and warp_and_crop_face to ensure robust error management and to provide meaningful feedback to the user regarding the nature of the error.

**Output Example**: An example of the output when the FaceWarpException is raised might look like this: "In File /path/to/align_trans.py: No paddings to do, output_size must be None or (96, 112)". This output indicates the file location of the error and provides a clear message about the nature of the issue encountered.
### FunctionDef __str__(self)
**__str__**: The function of __str__ is to provide a string representation of the FaceWarpException object, including the file name and the string representation of its superclass.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· There are no parameters for this function.

**Code Description**: The __str__ method is an override of the default string representation method in Python. When called, it constructs a string that indicates the file in which the exception is defined, using the special variable `__file__`, which contains the path to the current file. It also calls the string representation of the superclass (using `super().__str__(self)`) to include any additional information that the parent class might provide. This allows for a more informative error message when the exception is raised, aiding in debugging and logging by clearly indicating where the exception originated.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the superclass of FaceWarpException has a properly defined __str__ method to provide meaningful output. This method is typically called when the exception is printed or logged, making it crucial for effective error handling.

**Output Example**: An example of the output from this method might look like: "In File /path/to/extras/facexlib/detection/align_trans.py: [SuperClass Error Message]". This output will vary depending on the actual file path and the message returned by the superclass's __str__ method.

## FunctionDef get_reference_facial_points(output_size, inner_padding_factor, outer_padding, default_square)
**get_reference_facial_points**: The function of get_reference_facial_points is to compute the reference coordinates of five key facial points based on specified cropping and padding settings.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· output_size: (w, h) or None - size of the aligned face image.
· inner_padding_factor: (w_factor, h_factor) - padding factor for the inner (w, h).
· outer_padding: (w_pad, h_pad) - each row is a pair of coordinates (x, y).
· default_square: True or False - if True, sets default crop_size to (112, 112); otherwise, (96, 112).

**Code Description**: The get_reference_facial_points function is designed to return the coordinates of five reference facial points, which are crucial for facial alignment tasks in image processing. The function begins by initializing the reference points and default crop size. If the default_square parameter is set to True, it adjusts the reference points and crop size to create a square inner region.

The function then checks if the provided output_size matches the default crop size. If they are equal, it returns the reference points directly. If no padding is specified and output_size is provided, it raises a FaceWarpException, indicating that the output size must be None or match the default crop size.

Next, the function validates the inner_padding_factor to ensure it is within the range of 0 to 1. If padding is required but output_size is not provided, it calculates the output_size based on the crop size and inner padding factor. It also checks that the outer padding does not exceed the output size.

The function then applies the inner padding factor to adjust the reference points and crop size accordingly. After that, it calculates the scale factor needed to resize the padded inner region to fit the output size minus the outer padding. The reference points are scaled based on this factor.

Finally, the function adds the outer padding to the transformed reference points and returns the resulting coordinates. This function is called within the warp_and_crop_face function when the reference points are not provided, ensuring that the facial points used for alignment are appropriately calculated based on the specified crop size and padding settings.

**Note**: It is essential to ensure that the output_size, inner_padding_factor, and outer_padding parameters are set correctly to avoid exceptions. The function is integral to facial image processing and should be used with a clear understanding of the expected input parameters.

**Output Example**: A possible appearance of the code's return value could be a 5x2 numpy array representing the transformed coordinates, such as:
```
array([[ 30.5,  40.2],
       [ 50.1,  60.3],
       [ 70.4,  80.5],
       [ 90.6, 100.7],
       [110.8, 120.9]])
```
## FunctionDef get_affine_transform_matrix(src_pts, dst_pts)
**get_affine_transform_matrix**: The function of get_affine_transform_matrix is to compute the affine transformation matrix that maps a set of source points to a set of destination points.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· parameter1: src_pts - A Kx2 numpy array representing the source points matrix, where each row corresponds to a pair of coordinates (x, y).
· parameter2: dst_pts - A Kx2 numpy array representing the destination points matrix, where each row corresponds to a pair of coordinates (x, y).

**Code Description**: The get_affine_transform_matrix function calculates an affine transformation matrix that can be used to transform a set of points from a source configuration (src_pts) to a destination configuration (dst_pts). The function begins by initializing a transformation matrix (tfm) as an identity matrix. It then appends a column of ones to both the source and destination points to facilitate the matrix operations required for affine transformation.

The function uses the least squares method to solve for the transformation parameters that best fit the source points to the destination points. The rank of the resulting matrix is checked to determine if a full affine transformation can be computed or if a simpler transformation is necessary. If the rank is 3, a full 2x3 transformation matrix is returned. If the rank is 2, a reduced transformation matrix is returned, indicating that the transformation is not fully determined.

This function is called within the warp_and_crop_face function, which applies the computed affine transformation to an input image based on facial landmarks. The warp_and_crop_face function takes source images and facial points, computes the necessary reference points, and then determines the appropriate transformation type to apply. When the align_type parameter is set to 'affine', it directly invokes get_affine_transform_matrix to obtain the transformation matrix needed for the image warping process.

**Note**: It is essential to ensure that the shapes of src_pts and dst_pts are compatible and that both contain more than two points for the function to operate correctly. The function assumes that the input points are in the correct format and does not perform extensive validation on the input data.

**Output Example**: A possible appearance of the code's return value could be:
```
array([[1.0, 0.0, 0.0],
       [0.0, 1.0, 0.0]], dtype=float32)
```
This output represents an identity transformation, indicating that the source points do not need to be altered to match the destination points.
## FunctionDef warp_and_crop_face(src_img, facial_pts, reference_pts, crop_size, align_type)
**warp_and_crop_face**: The function of warp_and_crop_face is to apply an affine transformation to an input image based on specified facial landmarks and crop the image to a defined size.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· src_img: 3x3 np.array - The input image to be warped and cropped.
· facial_pts: A list of K coordinates (x,y) or a Kx2 or 2xK np.array representing facial landmark points.
· reference_pts: A list of K coordinates (x,y), a Kx2 or 2xK np.array for reference facial points, or None to use default reference points.
· crop_size: (w, h) - The desired output size of the face image.
· align_type: A string indicating the type of transformation, which can be 'similarity', 'cv2_affine', or 'affine'.

**Code Description**: The warp_and_crop_face function is designed to perform facial image alignment and cropping by applying an affine transformation based on the provided facial landmark points and reference points. The function begins by checking if reference points are provided; if not, it defaults to predefined facial points based on the specified crop size. It validates the shapes of both the facial points and reference points to ensure they conform to the expected dimensions, raising a FaceWarpException if they do not.

Depending on the specified align_type, the function computes the appropriate transformation matrix using either a similarity transform, an affine transform based on the first three points, or a full affine transform using all points. The transformation matrix is then applied to the input image using OpenCV's warpAffine function, resulting in a cropped and aligned face image of the specified size.

This function is called within the __align_multi method of the RetinaFace class, where it processes multiple facial landmarks detected in an image. For each set of landmarks, it constructs the facial points and invokes warp_and_crop_face to obtain the aligned face images, which are then collected and returned alongside their corresponding bounding boxes and landmarks.

**Note**: It is crucial to ensure that the input parameters, particularly the shapes of facial_pts and reference_pts, are correctly formatted to avoid exceptions. The function is integral to facial recognition and processing tasks, and proper handling of the FaceWarpException is necessary for robust error management.

**Output Example**: A possible appearance of the code's return value could be a cropped face image represented as a numpy array, such as:
```
array([[[255, 255, 255],
        [255, 255, 255],
        [255, 255, 255],
        ...],
       [[255, 255, 255],
        [255, 255, 255],
        [255, 255, 255],
        ...],
       ...])
```
