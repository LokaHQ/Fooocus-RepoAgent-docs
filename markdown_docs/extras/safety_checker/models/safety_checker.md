## FunctionDef cosine_distance(image_embeds, text_embeds)
**cosine_distance**: The function of cosine_distance is to compute the cosine similarity between two sets of embeddings: image embeddings and text embeddings.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· parameter1: image_embeds - A tensor representing the embeddings of images, which are expected to be in a multi-dimensional format suitable for cosine similarity calculations.
· parameter2: text_embeds - A tensor representing the embeddings of text, which are also expected to be in a multi-dimensional format.

**Code Description**: The cosine_distance function normalizes the input tensors for image embeddings and text embeddings using the `nn.functional.normalize` method from PyTorch. This normalization process ensures that the embeddings are unit vectors, which is essential for accurately calculating cosine similarity. After normalization, the function computes the cosine similarity by performing a matrix multiplication between the normalized image embeddings and the transpose of the normalized text embeddings using `torch.mm`. The result is a tensor that contains the cosine similarity scores between each image embedding and each text embedding.

This function is called within the forward and forward_onnx methods of the StableDiffusionSafetyChecker class. In the forward method, cosine_distance is used to calculate two sets of cosine distances: one between image embeddings and special care embeddings, and another between image embeddings and concept embeddings. The results are then processed to determine scores and potential NSFW content in the images. Similarly, in the forward_onnx method, cosine_distance is employed to compute the same distances, and the results are used to adjust scores and identify images that may contain NSFW content. The output of cosine_distance directly influences the filtering mechanism applied to the images, where images identified as potentially containing NSFW content are replaced with black images.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the input tensors for image_embeds and text_embeds are properly formatted and normalized before calling this function, as the accuracy of the cosine similarity results depends on the quality of the input embeddings.

**Output Example**: A possible appearance of the code's return value could be a 2D tensor where each element represents the cosine similarity score between an image embedding and a text embedding, such as:
```
tensor([[0.85, 0.76, 0.65],
        [0.80, 0.70, 0.60],
        [0.90, 0.80, 0.75]])
```
## ClassDef StableDiffusionSafetyChecker
**StableDiffusionSafetyChecker**: The function of StableDiffusionSafetyChecker is to evaluate images for potentially unsafe content and return modified images along with indicators of whether any unsafe content was detected.

**attributes**: The attributes of this Class.
· config_class: Specifies the configuration class used for the model, which is CLIPConfig.
· main_input_name: Indicates the main input name for the model, set to "clip_input".
· _no_split_modules: A list of module names that should not be split during model parallelism, specifically containing "CLIPEncoderLayer".

· visual_projection: A linear layer that projects the output of the vision model to a specified projection dimension.
· concept_embeds: A tensor of shape (17, config.projection_dim) that holds the concept embeddings, which are not trainable.
· special_care_embeds: A tensor of shape (3, config.projection_dim) that holds special care embeddings, which are also not trainable.

· special_care_embeds_weights: A tensor of shape (3) that holds weights for the special care embeddings, which are not trainable.

**Code Description**: The StableDiffusionSafetyChecker class inherits from PreTrainedModel and is designed to assess images for potentially harmful content, such as NSFW (Not Safe For Work) material. Upon initialization, it sets up various parameters and models necessary for processing visual inputs. The forward method takes in clip_input and images, processes them through the vision model, and computes cosine distances to determine the similarity between the image embeddings and predefined concept embeddings. It evaluates whether each image contains any harmful content based on these distances and the associated weights. If any images are flagged as containing NSFW content, they are replaced with black images (zeros) to prevent their display.

The class is invoked within the Censor class, specifically in the init method. Here, an instance of StableDiffusionSafetyChecker is created using a pre-trained model and configuration. This instance is then used to evaluate images processed by the Censor class, ensuring that any potentially harmful content is filtered out before further processing or display.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the model is properly initialized with the correct configuration and that the input images are in the expected format. The adjustment parameter can be tuned to modify the sensitivity of the NSFW filtering.

**Output Example**: The output of the forward method may look like this:
- For an input image that is flagged as NSFW, the output will be:
  - images: A black image tensor of the same shape as the input.
  - has_nsfw_concepts: A boolean tensor indicating that NSFW content was detected (e.g., [True]).
  
- For an input image that is deemed safe, the output will be:
  - images: The original image tensor.
  - has_nsfw_concepts: A boolean tensor indicating no NSFW content was detected (e.g., [False]).
### FunctionDef __init__(self, config)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize the StableDiffusionSafetyChecker object with the provided configuration.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· config: An instance of CLIPConfig that contains configuration settings for the model.

**Code Description**: The __init__ function serves as the constructor for the StableDiffusionSafetyChecker class. It begins by invoking the constructor of its superclass using `super().__init__(config)`, which allows it to inherit properties and methods from the parent class while passing the configuration object for initialization.

Next, the function initializes the vision model by creating an instance of CLIPVisionModel, using the vision configuration specified in the provided config object. This model is responsible for processing visual inputs.

Following this, a linear layer is defined with `self.visual_projection`, which projects the output of the vision model into a specified dimensionality defined by `config.projection_dim`. This layer does not use a bias term, as indicated by `bias=False`.

The function also initializes several parameters that are crucial for the model's operation. `self.concept_embeds` is a tensor of shape (17, config.projection_dim) initialized with ones, and it is set to not require gradients during training, meaning it will not be updated through backpropagation. This tensor likely represents embeddings for different concepts that the model will recognize.

Similarly, `self.special_care_embeds` is another tensor of shape (3, config.projection_dim), also initialized with ones and set to not require gradients. This may represent embeddings for special cases that need additional attention from the model.

Lastly, `self.concept_embeds_weights` and `self.special_care_embeds_weights` are parameters initialized as tensors of shape (17) and (3), respectively, both set to ones and marked as non-trainable. These weights may be used to scale the importance of the corresponding embeddings during the model's operations.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the config parameter passed to this function is properly configured, as it directly influences the initialization of the model components. The non-trainable nature of the embeddings and weights should be considered when designing the training process, as they will not adapt during training.

### FunctionDef forward(self, clip_input, images)
**forward**: The function of forward is to process input images and their corresponding CLIP embeddings to determine potential NSFW content and return modified images along with a flag indicating the presence of such content.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· parameter1: clip_input - A tensor representing the input embeddings from the CLIP model, which are used to assess the content of the images.
· parameter2: images - A tensor or array of images that are to be evaluated for NSFW content.

**Code Description**: The forward function begins by obtaining a pooled output from a vision model using the provided clip_input. This pooled output is then transformed into image embeddings through a visual projection. The function calculates cosine distances between the image embeddings and two sets of reference embeddings: special care embeddings and concept embeddings, using the cosine_distance function. 

The cosine_distance function computes the cosine similarity between the image embeddings and the reference embeddings, returning a tensor of similarity scores. These scores are then processed in the forward function to generate scores for special care and concept categories. For each image in the batch, the function initializes a result dictionary to store special scores, special care concepts, concept scores, and bad concepts. 

An adjustment variable is introduced to fine-tune the filtering process, allowing for a stronger NSFW filter at the risk of misclassifying benign images. The function iterates through the special cosine distances and concept distances, comparing them against predefined thresholds to populate the result dictionary accordingly. If any scores exceed their respective thresholds, the corresponding concepts are flagged.

After processing all images, the function checks for the presence of NSFW concepts. If any are detected, the original images are replaced with black images (tensors of zeros) to prevent displaying inappropriate content. A warning is logged to inform users of the potential NSFW content detected.

The output of the forward function consists of the modified images and a list indicating which images contained NSFW content. This function is crucial for ensuring that images processed through the safety checker are evaluated for appropriateness, leveraging the cosine_distance function to assess similarity and determine content suitability.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the input tensors for clip_input and images are properly formatted and compatible with the model's requirements. The adjustment variable can be tuned to balance the sensitivity of the NSFW filtering process.

**Output Example**: A possible appearance of the code's return value could be a tuple containing the modified images and a list of boolean values indicating the presence of NSFW content, such as:
```
(tensor([[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]]), [True, False])
```

### FunctionDef forward_onnx(self, clip_input, images)
**forward_onnx**: The function of forward_onnx is to process input tensors representing images and their corresponding embeddings to identify and filter out potentially NSFW (Not Safe For Work) content.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· parameter1: clip_input - A tensor of type torch.Tensor that represents the input embeddings derived from the images, which are processed to extract visual features.
· parameter2: images - A tensor of type torch.Tensor that contains the actual image data, which will be modified if NSFW content is detected.

**Code Description**: The forward_onnx function begins by passing the clip_input tensor through a vision model to obtain a pooled output, which is then projected into image embeddings using a visual projection layer. The function calculates the cosine distance between these image embeddings and two sets of reference embeddings: special care embeddings and concept embeddings. 

The cosine_distance function, which is called within this method, computes the cosine similarity between the image embeddings and the reference embeddings. This similarity is crucial for determining how closely the input images align with potentially sensitive content. 

An adjustment factor is introduced to fine-tune the sensitivity of the NSFW filtering mechanism. The special_scores are computed by subtracting the weights associated with the special care embeddings from the special cosine distances, adjusted by the defined threshold. The function then checks if any of the special scores exceed zero, indicating the presence of special care content.

Next, a special adjustment is applied to the concept scores based on the results of the special care check. The concept scores are calculated similarly, incorporating the concept embeddings' weights. The function finally checks for any images that exceed the NSFW threshold based on the concept scores. If any images are flagged as containing NSFW content, they are replaced with a black image (tensor filled with zeros).

The output of the function consists of the modified images tensor and a boolean tensor indicating which images were identified as containing NSFW content. This function plays a critical role in ensuring that the images processed by the system are safe for viewing, particularly in contexts where sensitive content may be present.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the input tensors for clip_input and images are properly formatted and contain valid data before calling this function, as the accuracy of the NSFW filtering depends on the quality of the input embeddings and images.

**Output Example**: A possible appearance of the code's return value could be a tensor representing the modified images and a boolean tensor indicating NSFW content, such as:
```
(images_tensor, has_nsfw_concepts_tensor)
``` 
Where images_tensor may contain modified image data, and has_nsfw_concepts_tensor could look like:
```
tensor([False, True, False])
```
