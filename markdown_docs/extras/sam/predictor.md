## ClassDef SamPredictor
**SamPredictor**: The function of SamPredictor is to utilize the SAM model for efficient mask prediction on images based on user-defined prompts.

**attributes**: The attributes of this Class.
· model: An instance of the Sam model used for mask prediction.
· load_device: The device where the model is loaded for inference.
· offload_device: The device where the model is offloaded to save memory.
· patcher: An instance of ModelPatcher that manages the model's loading and offloading.
· transform: An instance of ResizeLongestSide used to preprocess images for the model.
· original_size: The original dimensions of the image before transformation.
· input_size: The dimensions of the image after transformation.
· features: The computed image embeddings for the currently set image.
· is_image_set: A boolean flag indicating whether an image has been set for prediction.

**Code Description**: The SamPredictor class is designed to facilitate the process of image segmentation by leveraging the capabilities of the SAM (Segment Anything Model). Upon initialization, it requires a Sam model and optionally specifies devices for loading and offloading the model. The class provides methods to set an image, calculate its embeddings, and predict masks based on various input prompts such as point coordinates, labels, and bounding boxes.

The `set_image` method allows users to input an image in a specified format, transforming it to the required format for the model. The `predict` method is the core functionality, enabling users to generate masks based on the currently set image and the provided prompts. It handles various input types, including point coordinates and bounding boxes, and can return multiple masks for ambiguous prompts.

The class is utilized in the `generate_mask_from_image` function found in the `extras/inpaint_mask.py` file. This function orchestrates the process of generating masks from an input image, first checking if the SAM model is to be used. It sets the image in the SamPredictor instance and applies transformations to any detected bounding boxes before invoking the `predict_torch` method to obtain the masks. The results are then processed and returned, indicating the number of detections made.

**Note**: Users should ensure that an image is set using the `set_image` method before attempting to call the `predict` method, as it will raise an error if no image is set. Additionally, the input image must be in the correct format, and the dimensions should align with the model's expectations.

**Output Example**: A possible output from the `predict` method could be:
- Masks: A numpy array of shape (C, H, W) where C is the number of masks predicted, and (H, W) are the dimensions of the original image.
- IOU Predictions: A numpy array of shape (C,) containing the model's quality predictions for each mask.
- Low Resolution Masks: A numpy array of shape (C, 256, 256) representing the low-resolution logits that can be used for subsequent predictions.
### FunctionDef __init__(self, model, load_device, offload_device)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize the SamPredictor class, setting up the model and its operational devices for mask prediction.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· model: An instance of the Sam class, which is the model used for mask prediction.
· load_device: The device where the model is loaded for computation, defaulting to the value returned by model_management.text_encoder_device().
· offload_device: The device where the model can offload its computations, defaulting to the value returned by model_management.text_encoder_offload_device().

**Code Description**: The __init__ method of the SamPredictor class is responsible for initializing an instance of the predictor with a specified model and the devices for loading and offloading computations. Upon invocation, it first calls the superclass's __init__ method to ensure any inherited initialization is performed. 

The method accepts three parameters: 
1. model: This is a required parameter that specifies the Sam model to be used for mask prediction. The model is expected to be an instance of the Sam class, which contains the necessary architecture and weights for performing predictions.
2. load_device: This optional parameter determines the device on which the model will be loaded. By default, it uses the function model_management.text_encoder_device() to select the appropriate device based on the system's configuration.
3. offload_device: This optional parameter specifies the device for offloading computations. It defaults to the output of model_management.text_encoder_offload_device(), which similarly selects a device based on configuration settings.

Inside the method, the model is transferred to the offload_device using the model's to() method. This is crucial for ensuring that the model operates on the correct device, which can be either a CPU or GPU, depending on the system's capabilities and the configuration settings.

The method also initializes a ModelPatcher instance, which is responsible for managing and applying patches to the model's weights and structure. This allows for modifications and enhancements to the model's behavior without altering its core architecture. The ModelPatcher is initialized with the model, load_device, and offload_device parameters.

Additionally, the method sets up a transformation for resizing images, specifically using the ResizeLongestSide class, which is initialized with the image size defined in the model. Finally, it calls the reset_image() method to ensure that the state of the image-related attributes is cleared, preparing the instance for subsequent image processing tasks.

The __init__ method is critical as it establishes the operational context for the SamPredictor class, ensuring that the model is correctly configured and ready for efficient mask prediction based on user-defined parameters.

**Note**: It is essential to ensure that the model passed to the __init__ method is properly instantiated and compatible with the expected architecture for mask prediction. Additionally, the load_device and offload_device should be configured according to the available hardware resources to optimize performance.

### FunctionDef set_image(self, image, image_format)
**set_image**: The function of set_image is to calculate the image embeddings for the provided image, enabling masks to be predicted with the 'predict' method.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· parameter1: image (np.ndarray) - The image for calculating masks. Expects an image in HWC uint8 format, with pixel values in [0, 255].  
· parameter2: image_format (str) - The color format of the image, which can be either 'RGB' or 'BGR'. Default is 'RGB'.

**Code Description**: The set_image function is designed to prepare an image for mask prediction by calculating its embeddings. It begins by asserting that the provided image_format is valid, ensuring it is either 'RGB' or 'BGR'. If the specified image_format does not match the expected format of the model, the function reverses the color channels of the image to align with the model's requirements.

Next, the function transforms the input image into a format that the model can process. This transformation is handled by the self.transform.apply_image method, which prepares the image for further processing. The transformed image is then converted into a PyTorch tensor and rearranged to match the expected input shape for the model, specifically a 4-dimensional tensor with dimensions corresponding to batch size, channels, height, and width.

Following this transformation, the set_image function calls the set_torch_image method, passing the processed tensor and the original image dimensions. The set_torch_image function is responsible for calculating the image embeddings and preparing the model for mask prediction tasks.

The set_image function is called by the generate_mask_from_image function, which is part of the mask generation workflow. When an image is provided, generate_mask_from_image checks if the mask model is set to 'sam' and, if so, invokes set_image to prepare the image for mask prediction. This relationship highlights the role of set_image as a critical step in the image processing pipeline, ensuring that the model can effectively utilize the provided image data.

**Note**: It is essential to ensure that the input image is in the correct format and that the image_format parameter accurately reflects the color format of the image to avoid runtime errors during processing.
***
### FunctionDef set_torch_image(self, transformed_image, original_image_size)
**set_torch_image**: The function of set_torch_image is to calculate the image embeddings for a provided transformed image, enabling masks to be predicted with the 'predict' method.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· parameter1: transformed_image (torch.Tensor) - The input image, with shape 1x3xHxW, which has been transformed with ResizeLongestSide.
· parameter2: original_image_size (tuple(int, int)) - The size of the image before transformation, in (H, W) format.

**Code Description**: The set_torch_image function is designed to process a transformed image tensor and compute its embeddings for subsequent mask prediction tasks. It begins by asserting that the input tensor adheres to the expected shape and format, specifically checking that it is a 4-dimensional tensor with a channel dimension of 3 (representing RGB channels) and that the maximum spatial dimension matches the model's expected input size. This validation ensures that the input is suitable for the model's architecture.

Upon successful validation, the function invokes reset_image to clear any previously stored image data and attributes, preparing the instance for the new image. It then stores the original image size and the input size derived from the transformed image. The function proceeds to load the model onto the GPU using the load_model_gpu function, which facilitates efficient inference by ensuring the model is ready for processing.

Next, the transformed image tensor is preprocessed using the model's preprocessing method, which likely includes normalization and resizing operations tailored for the model's requirements. The preprocessed image is then passed through the model's image encoder to compute the image features, which are stored in the features attribute of the SamPredictor instance. Finally, the is_image_set attribute is set to True, indicating that a valid image is now set for further operations.

The set_torch_image function is called by the set_image method within the SamPredictor class. The set_image method first transforms a raw image input (in numpy array format) into a tensor format compatible with the model, and then it calls set_torch_image to handle the embedding calculation. This relationship highlights the role of set_torch_image as a critical step in the image processing pipeline, ensuring that the model can effectively utilize the provided image data for mask prediction tasks.

**Note**: It is essential to ensure that the transformed_image tensor is correctly formatted and that the original_image_size accurately reflects the dimensions of the image prior to transformation to avoid runtime errors during processing.

### FunctionDef predict(self, point_coords, point_labels, box, mask_input, multimask_output, return_logits)
**predict**: The function of predict is to predict masks for the given input prompts, using the currently set image.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· point_coords (np.ndarray or None): A Nx2 array of point prompts to the model, where each point is represented in (X,Y) pixel coordinates.  
· point_labels (np.ndarray or None): A length N array of labels corresponding to the point prompts, where 1 indicates a foreground point and 0 indicates a background point.  
· box (np.ndarray or None): A length 4 array representing a box prompt to the model, in XYXY format.  
· mask_input (np.ndarray): A low-resolution mask input to the model, typically from a previous prediction iteration, formatted as 1xHxW, where H=W=256 for SAM.  
· multimask_output (bool): If true, the model will return three masks, which can improve results for ambiguous input prompts.  
· return_logits (bool): If true, the function returns un-thresholded mask logits instead of binary masks.  

**Code Description**: The predict function is designed to generate mask predictions based on various input prompts, including point coordinates, labels, box coordinates, and previous mask inputs. Before proceeding with the predictions, the function checks if an image has been set for prediction; if not, it raises a RuntimeError indicating that an image must be set with the .set_image(...) method prior to mask prediction.

The function processes the input prompts by transforming them into the appropriate format for the model. If point coordinates are provided, it asserts that corresponding point labels are also supplied. The coordinates and labels are then converted into torch tensors and adjusted to match the original image size. Similarly, if a box prompt is provided, it is transformed and converted into a tensor. The mask input, if provided, is also converted into a tensor.

Once the input prompts are prepared, the function calls the predict_torch method to perform the actual mask prediction. This method utilizes the model's prompt encoder to embed the provided prompts into a suitable format for mask prediction. It then generates low-resolution masks and quality predictions based on the embedded prompts and the image features.

The output of the predict function consists of three components: the predicted masks in CxHxW format, an array containing the model's predictions for the quality of each mask, and an array of low-resolution logits that can be used in subsequent iterations. The function ensures that the output masks are detached from the computation graph and converted back to numpy arrays for easier handling.

**Note**: It is crucial to ensure that the input tensors are properly formatted and that an image is set before calling this function to avoid runtime errors. Additionally, the multimask_output parameter can be adjusted based on the nature of the input prompts to optimize the quality of the predictions.

**Output Example**: A possible return value from the function could be three numpy arrays: the output masks in CxHxW format, an array of length C containing the model's predictions for mask quality, and an array of low-resolution logits in CxHxW format.

### FunctionDef predict_torch(self, point_coords, point_labels, boxes, mask_input, multimask_output, return_logits)
**predict_torch**: The function of predict_torch is to predict masks for the given input prompts using the currently set image.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· point_coords (torch.Tensor or None): A BxNx2 array of point prompts to the model, where each point is represented in (X,Y) pixel coordinates.
· point_labels (torch.Tensor or None): A BxN array of labels corresponding to the point prompts, where 1 indicates a foreground point and 0 indicates a background point.
· boxes (torch.Tensor or None): A Bx4 array representing box prompts to the model in XYXY format.
· mask_input (torch.Tensor or None): A low-resolution mask input to the model, typically from a previous prediction iteration, formatted as Bx1xHxW, where H=W=256 for SAM.
· multimask_output (bool): A flag indicating whether the model should return multiple masks; if true, it can produce better results for ambiguous prompts.
· return_logits (bool): A flag indicating whether to return un-thresholded mask logits instead of binary masks.

**Code Description**: The predict_torch function is designed to generate mask predictions based on various input prompts, including point coordinates, labels, box coordinates, and previous mask inputs. It first checks if an image has been set for prediction; if not, it raises a RuntimeError. The function then processes the input tensors, transferring them to the appropriate device for computation. 

The function utilizes the model's prompt encoder to embed the provided prompts (points, boxes, and masks) into a format suitable for mask prediction. Following this, it calls the model's mask decoder to generate low-resolution masks and quality predictions based on the embedded prompts and the image features. The generated masks are then upscaled to match the original image resolution. Depending on the value of the return_logits parameter, the function either thresholds the masks to produce binary outputs or returns the raw logits.

The predict_torch function is called by the predict method within the SamPredictor class, which prepares the input data and invokes predict_torch to obtain the mask predictions. Additionally, it is utilized in the generate_mask_from_image function, where it processes the image and applies transformations to the bounding boxes before calling predict_torch to generate the final masks.

**Note**: It is crucial to ensure that the input tensors are properly formatted and that an image is set before calling this function to avoid runtime errors.

**Output Example**: A possible return value from the function could be three tensors: the output masks in BxCxHxW format, an array of shape BxC containing the model's predictions for mask quality, and an array of low-resolution logits in BxCxHxW format.

### FunctionDef get_image_embedding(self)
**get_image_embedding**: The function of get_image_embedding is to return the image embeddings for the currently set image.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· There are no parameters for this function.

**Code Description**: The get_image_embedding function retrieves the image embeddings associated with the image that has been set in the object. The function first checks if an image has been set by evaluating the boolean attribute `is_image_set`. If no image is set, it raises a RuntimeError, indicating that the user must call the `.set_image(...)` method to set an image before attempting to generate an embedding. 

Next, the function asserts that the `features` attribute is not None, which ensures that the embedding features exist for the currently set image. If the assertion fails, it raises an AssertionError with a message indicating that features must exist if an image has been set. 

If both conditions are satisfied, the function returns the `features`, which is expected to be a tensor of shape 1xCxHxW. In this shape, C represents the embedding dimension (typically 256), while H and W represent the spatial dimensions of the embedding (typically both 64). The returned tensor is of type `torch.Tensor`, which is a core data structure in the PyTorch library used for tensor computations.

**Note**: It is essential to ensure that an image is set and that the features have been computed before calling this function. Failure to do so will result in runtime errors.

**Output Example**: A possible appearance of the code's return value could be a tensor like the following:
```
tensor([[[[0.1234, 0.5678, ..., 0.9101],
          [0.2345, 0.6789, ..., 0.1112],
          ...,
          [0.3456, 0.7890, ..., 0.2223],
          [0.4567, 0.8901, ..., 0.3334]]]])
```
This output represents a tensor with shape 1x256x64x64, where the values are the computed embeddings for the set image.
***
### FunctionDef device(self)
**device**: The function of device is to retrieve the device on which the model is located.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· There are no parameters for this function.

**Code Description**: The device function is a method defined within the SamPredictor class. It returns the device attribute of the model contained within the patcher object. The return type of this function is torch.device, which indicates that it provides information about the hardware device (such as CPU or GPU) that the model is currently utilizing for computation. This is particularly useful in machine learning contexts where the choice of device can significantly impact performance and resource management. By calling this function, users can easily determine where the model is being executed, allowing for better optimization and debugging of the code.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the patcher object is properly initialized and that the model attribute is set before calling this function. Otherwise, it may lead to errors or unexpected behavior.

**Output Example**: A possible return value of this function could be `torch.device('cuda:0')`, indicating that the model is running on the first GPU device. Alternatively, it could return `torch.device('cpu')`, indicating that the model is running on the CPU.
***
### FunctionDef reset_image(self)
**reset_image**: The function of reset_image is to reset the currently set image and its associated attributes.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· There are no parameters for this function.

**Code Description**: The reset_image function is responsible for resetting the state of the image-related attributes within the SamPredictor class. When invoked, it sets the boolean attribute is_image_set to False, indicating that no image is currently set for processing. Additionally, it clears the features attribute, which likely holds the computed embeddings or features of the image, by setting it to None. The function also resets the original height (orig_h) and width (orig_w) of the image, as well as the input height (input_h) and width (input_w), all to None. This ensures that any previous image data is cleared, preparing the instance for a new image to be set.

The reset_image function is called in two places within the SamPredictor class. Firstly, it is invoked in the __init__ method, which initializes the SamPredictor instance. This ensures that the image state is reset upon creation of the object, providing a clean slate for any subsequent image processing. Secondly, it is called in the set_torch_image method, which is responsible for setting a new image and calculating its embeddings. By calling reset_image at the beginning of set_torch_image, the function guarantees that any previously set image data is cleared before new data is processed, thus preventing any potential conflicts or errors from residual data.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that reset_image is called before setting a new image to avoid any unintended behavior due to leftover state from a previous image.
