## FunctionDef patched_encode_token_weights(self, token_weight_pairs)
**patched_encode_token_weights**: The function of patched_encode_token_weights is to encode token weights while adjusting for special cases such as empty inputs or varying weights.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· parameter1: token_weight_pairs - A list of tuples, where each tuple contains a token and its associated weight.

**Code Description**: The patched_encode_token_weights function processes a list of token-weight pairs to generate encoded representations of the tokens while considering their weights. The function begins by initializing an empty list called to_encode, a variable max_token_len to track the maximum length of tokens, and a boolean has_weights to determine if any weights differ from 1.0.

The function iterates over each token-weight pair in token_weight_pairs, extracting the tokens and updating max_token_len and has_weights accordingly. If any weights are found to be different from 1.0, has_weights is set to True. After processing the input, the function checks the number of sections (i.e., the number of token lists) and whether weights are present. If either condition is met, it appends a list of empty tokens generated by the gen_empty_tokens function, which is responsible for creating a valid token representation when the input is insufficient.

The function then calls the encode method to obtain encoded outputs and pooled representations for the tokens. If pooled is not None, it retrieves the first pooled output and moves it to the appropriate device using the intermediate_device function, which ensures that the computations are performed on the correct hardware (CPU or GPU).

Next, the function processes each section of encoded tokens. If weights are present, it adjusts the encoded values based on their corresponding weights, ensuring that the mean of the encoded output is preserved. The adjusted outputs are collected in a list called output.

Finally, the function returns the concatenated encoded outputs along with the first pooled representation, both moved to the appropriate device. This function is called within the patch_all_clip function, which modifies the behavior of the ClipTokenWeightEncoder and other related classes to utilize the patched_encode_token_weights function instead of the original implementation. This integration allows for enhanced handling of token weights during encoding, ensuring that the model can accommodate various input scenarios effectively.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the input token_weight_pairs is structured correctly, as the function relies on the presence of valid token-weight pairs to perform its operations. Additionally, the special_tokens dictionary used in gen_empty_tokens must contain the necessary keys to avoid unexpected behavior.

**Output Example**: A possible return value of the function could be a tensor representation of the encoded tokens, such as:
- torch.tensor([[0.1, 0.2, 0.3], [0.4, 0.5, 0.6]]) along with the pooled representation, which could be:
- torch.tensor([[0.7, 0.8, 0.9]]).
## FunctionDef patched_SDClipModel__init__(self, max_length, freeze, layer, layer_idx, textmodel_json_config, dtype, special_tokens, layer_norm_hidden_state)
**patched_SDClipModel__init__**: The function of patched_SDClipModel__init__ is to initialize an instance of the SDClipModel with specific configurations and parameters for text processing.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· max_length: An integer that specifies the maximum length of the input text, defaulting to 77.
· freeze: A boolean indicating whether to freeze the model parameters during training, defaulting to True.
· layer: A string that specifies which layer of the model to use, defaulting to "last".
· layer_idx: An optional integer that indicates the index of the layer to be used if the layer parameter is set to "hidden".
· textmodel_json_config: A string that specifies the path to the JSON configuration file for the text model, defaulting to a predefined path if not provided.
· dtype: The data type to which the model's parameters should be cast, if specified.
· special_tokens: A dictionary that defines special tokens used in the model, defaulting to predefined start, end, and pad tokens if not provided.
· layer_norm_hidden_state: A boolean indicating whether to apply layer normalization to the hidden state, defaulting to True.
· **kwargs: Additional keyword arguments that may be passed to the function.

**Code Description**: The patched_SDClipModel__init__ function is designed to initialize the SDClipModel with various configurable parameters that dictate its behavior during text processing tasks. Upon invocation, it first calls the constructor of the parent class, torch.nn.Module, to ensure proper initialization of the neural network module.

The function asserts that the specified layer is valid by checking it against a predefined list of layers (self.LAYERS). If the special_tokens parameter is not provided, it initializes it with default token values. Similarly, if the textmodel_json_config is not specified, it constructs a default path to the configuration file for the CLIP text model.

The function then loads the model configuration from the JSON file and initializes the CLIPTextModel using the loaded configuration. It also manages the data type of the model's parameters based on the dtype argument and ensures that the model's embeddings are cast to float32.

If the freeze parameter is set to True, the function calls the freeze method to prevent the model's parameters from being updated during training. The max_length, layer, layer_idx, and special_tokens attributes are then set based on the provided arguments.

If the specified layer is "hidden", the function checks that layer_idx is provided and within valid bounds before invoking the clip_layer method to configure the model accordingly. Finally, it sets a default layer configuration for later reference.

This function is called within the patch_all_clip function, which serves to replace the original initialization method of the SDClipModel with this patched version. This allows for enhanced functionality and customization of the model's behavior during its initialization phase, ensuring that it operates with the desired configurations and optimizations.

**Note**: Users should ensure that the parameters provided to this function are correctly set to avoid runtime errors, particularly with respect to the layer and layer_idx parameters. Additionally, the management of special tokens and configuration paths is crucial for the proper functioning of the model.
## FunctionDef patched_SDClipModel_forward(self, tokens)
**patched_SDClipModel_forward**: The function of patched_SDClipModel_forward is to process input tokens through a transformer model and return the resulting hidden states and pooled output.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· self: An instance of the class that contains this method, which holds the model's configuration and state.
· tokens: A tensor containing the input token IDs that need to be processed by the transformer model.

**Code Description**: The patched_SDClipModel_forward function is designed to handle the forward pass of a modified SDClipModel. It begins by backing up the input embeddings of the transformer model to ensure that the original state can be restored after processing. The function retrieves the device on which the embeddings are stored and prepares the input tokens by setting up textual embeddings. The tokens are then converted into a LongTensor and moved to the appropriate device.

If attention masks are enabled, the function constructs an attention mask tensor that indicates which tokens should be attended to during processing. This mask is created by iterating through the token tensor and marking positions as attended until a special maximum token is encountered.

The function then calls the transformer model with the prepared input IDs and attention mask, specifying whether to output hidden states based on the layer configuration. After obtaining the outputs, it restores the original input embeddings.

Depending on the specified layer, the function extracts the relevant hidden state or pooled output. If the layer is set to "last," it retrieves the last hidden state; if "pooled," it gets the pooled output. For other layers, it accesses the hidden states at the specified index and applies layer normalization if required.

If the outputs contain a pooled output and a text projection matrix is defined, the pooled output is projected into the appropriate space.

Finally, the function returns the processed hidden states and pooled output as floating-point tensors.

This function is called within the patch_all_clip function, which modifies the behavior of the SDClipModel by replacing its original forward method with this patched version. This allows for enhanced functionality and customization of the model's forward pass, making it adaptable to specific use cases or improvements in performance.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the tokens passed to this function are properly formatted and that the model is configured correctly to utilize attention masks if required.

**Output Example**: A possible return value from this function could be two tensors: 
- z: A tensor of shape (batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size) representing the processed hidden states.
- pooled_output: A tensor of shape (batch_size, hidden_size) representing the pooled output, which may be None if not applicable.
## FunctionDef patched_ClipVisionModel__init__(self, json_config)
**patched_ClipVisionModel__init__**: The function of patched_ClipVisionModel__init__ is to initialize a modified version of the ClipVisionModel with specific configurations and device management.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· json_config: A string representing the path to a JSON configuration file that contains the model's configuration settings.

**Code Description**: The patched_ClipVisionModel__init__ function is designed to initialize an instance of the ClipVisionModel with custom configurations and device management tailored for optimized performance. 

Upon invocation, the function first reads the model configuration from a JSON file using the CLIPVisionConfig.from_json_file method. This configuration dictates the architecture and parameters of the model being initialized.

Next, the function determines the appropriate device for loading the model by calling ldm_patched.modules.model_management.text_encoder_device(), which assesses the current system's capabilities and VRAM state to decide whether to utilize a CPU or GPU. Similarly, it identifies an offload device for managing computational tasks that may exceed the primary device's capacity by invoking ldm_patched.modules.model_management.text_encoder_offload_device().

The function then checks if half-precision floating-point (FP16) calculations should be utilized by calling ldm_patched.modules.model_management.should_use_fp16(). This decision is based on the load device and whether performance is prioritized. If FP16 is suitable, the data type for the model is set to torch.float16; otherwise, it defaults to torch.float32.

Within a context manager that utilizes custom operations (use_patched_ops), the function initializes the model using the CLIPVisionModelWithProjection class, ensuring that the model's weights are not initialized at this stage to prevent unnecessary overhead.

After the model is created, it is transferred to the appropriate data type (either FP16 or FP32) based on the earlier determination. Finally, the function instantiates a ModelPatcher object, which is responsible for managing and applying patches to the model's weights and structure. This ModelPatcher is initialized with the model, load device, and offload device, facilitating modifications and enhancements to the model's behavior.

The patched_ClipVisionModel__init__ function is called within the patch_all_clip function, which serves to replace the original __init__ method of the ClipVisionModel class with this patched version. This integration allows for the modified initialization process to be utilized whenever an instance of ClipVisionModel is created, ensuring that the model benefits from the enhancements provided by the patched initialization.

**Note**: It is essential to ensure that the JSON configuration file is correctly formatted and accessible at the specified path to avoid initialization errors. Additionally, the management of devices and the choice of data types are critical for optimizing performance, particularly when working with large models or limited hardware resources.
## FunctionDef patched_ClipVisionModel_encode_image(self, image)

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· image: A tensor representing the image to be processed, expected to be compatible with the model's input requirements.

**Code Description**: The patched_ClipVisionModel_encode_image function is designed to facilitate the encoding of an image using a CLIP vision model. The function begins by loading the specified model onto the GPU using the load_model_gpu function from the model_management module. This ensures that the model is ready for efficient inference on the appropriate device.

Next, the function preprocesses the input image tensor by calling the clip_preprocess function from the clip_vision module. This preprocessing involves resizing, normalizing, and adjusting the image dimensions to ensure compatibility with the model's expected input format. The processed image tensor is then passed to the model for encoding.

The model generates outputs, which include various hidden states. The function iterates through these outputs, checking for non-null values. If the output key corresponds to 'hidden_states', it extracts the penultimate hidden state and transfers it to an intermediate device using the intermediate_device function from the model_management module. This step is crucial for managing device compatibility and ensuring efficient memory usage. For other output keys, the function also transfers the values to the intermediate device.

Finally, the function returns the processed outputs, which may include the penultimate hidden states and other model outputs, providing essential information for subsequent processing steps.

The patched_ClipVisionModel_encode_image function is called within the patch_all_clip function, which is responsible for applying various patches to the CLIP model components. By replacing the original encode_image method of the ClipVisionModel class with this patched version, the function ensures that the enhanced encoding process is utilized whenever images are processed by the model.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the input image tensor is correctly formatted and that the model has been successfully loaded onto the GPU before invoking this function to avoid runtime errors.

**Output Example**: A possible return value of the function could be a dictionary containing model outputs, including the penultimate hidden states, structured as follows:
{
    "penultimate_hidden_states": tensor of shape [batch_size, hidden_size],
    "other_output_key": tensor of shape [batch_size, ...]
}
