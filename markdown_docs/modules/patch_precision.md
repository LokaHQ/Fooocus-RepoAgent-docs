## FunctionDef patched_timestep_embedding(timesteps, dim, max_period, repeat_only)
**patched_timestep_embedding**: The function of patched_timestep_embedding is to generate a timestep embedding for input timesteps, which is consistent with the Kohya implementation to minimize discrepancies between model training and inference.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· timesteps: A tensor representing the input timesteps for which embeddings are to be generated.  
· dim: An integer specifying the dimensionality of the output embedding.  
· max_period: An optional integer (default is 10000) that determines the maximum period for frequency calculations.  
· repeat_only: A boolean (default is False) that specifies whether to repeat the timesteps without applying frequency transformations.

**Code Description**: The patched_timestep_embedding function computes embeddings for a given set of timesteps. If the repeat_only parameter is set to False, the function calculates a series of frequencies based on the specified dimension and maximum period. It then computes the cosine and sine of the product of the timesteps and these frequencies, concatenating them to form the final embedding. If the dimension is odd, an additional zero vector is appended to maintain the specified dimensionality. In the case where repeat_only is True, the function simply replicates the timesteps across the specified dimension without any transformation.

This function is called within the patch_all_precision function, where it replaces the existing timestep_embedding method in the ldm_patched.ldm.modules.diffusionmodules.openaimodel with the patched_timestep_embedding. This integration ensures that the model utilizes the updated embedding method during both training and inference, thereby aligning the behavior of the model across different phases of its lifecycle.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the input timesteps tensor is compatible with the specified device, as the function will transfer the frequency tensor to the same device as the timesteps. Users should also be aware of the implications of the repeat_only parameter, as it alters the output significantly by bypassing the frequency calculations.

**Output Example**: For an input tensor of timesteps with shape (batch_size, 1) and a specified dimension of 4, the output might look like:
```
tensor([[ 0.5403,  0.8415,  0.0000,  0.0000],
        [ 0.7071,  0.7071,  0.0000,  0.0000],
        [ 0.8776,  0.4794,  0.0000,  0.0000]])
``` 
This output represents the computed embeddings for the provided timesteps, formatted according to the specified dimensionality.
## FunctionDef patched_register_schedule(self, given_betas, beta_schedule, timesteps, linear_start, linear_end, cosine_s)
**patched_register_schedule**: The function of patched_register_schedule is to configure the beta schedule for a diffusion model, either using a provided set of beta values or generating them based on specified parameters.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· given_betas: An optional array of beta values to use instead of generating new ones. If provided, this will override the generated schedule.
· beta_schedule: A string that specifies the type of beta schedule to generate. Accepted values include "linear", "cosine", "squaredcos_cap_v2", "sqrt_linear", and "sqrt".
· timesteps: An integer representing the number of timesteps for which beta values should be generated.
· linear_start: A float that defines the starting value for the linear schedule (default is 1e-4).
· linear_end: A float that defines the ending value for the linear schedule (default is 2e-2).
· cosine_s: A float that is used in the cosine schedule to adjust the starting point (default is 8e-3).

**Code Description**: The patched_register_schedule function is designed to establish a beta schedule that is consistent with the Kohya framework, thereby minimizing discrepancies between model training and inference. The function begins by checking if a custom set of beta values (given_betas) has been provided. If so, it uses these values directly. If not, it calls the make_beta_schedule function to generate a new sequence of beta values based on the specified beta_schedule type and other parameters.

The generated beta values are then used to compute the corresponding alpha values, which are derived from the formula alphas = 1 - betas. The cumulative product of the alpha values is calculated using NumPy's cumprod function, which is essential for diffusion processes. The number of timesteps is extracted from the shape of the beta array, and several attributes of the class instance (self) are set, including num_timesteps, linear_start, and linear_end.

The function then computes the sigma values, which are critical for the diffusion model, using the formula sigmas = sqrt((1 - alphas_cumprod) / alphas_cumprod). These sigma values are set using the set_sigmas method. Similarly, the cumulative alpha values are converted to a PyTorch tensor and set using the set_alphas_cumprod method.

The patched_register_schedule function is called within the patch_all_precision function, which modifies the behavior of the ModelSamplingDiscrete class by replacing its _register_schedule method with this patched version. This integration ensures that the diffusion model operates with the correct beta schedule, thereby enhancing the model's performance and consistency.

**Note**: When using this function, it is important to ensure that the specified beta_schedule is valid and that the parameters are set appropriately to avoid unexpected results in the beta calculations.

**Output Example**: The function does not return a value, but it modifies the internal state of the class instance. The expected outcome is that the instance will have updated sigma and cumulative alpha values that are consistent with the specified beta schedule.
## FunctionDef patch_all_precision
**patch_all_precision**: The function of patch_all_precision is to update the timestep embedding and the schedule registration methods in the diffusion model to their patched versions.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· None

**Code Description**: The patch_all_precision function is responsible for modifying specific components of the diffusion model to ensure consistency and improved performance during both training and inference. It achieves this by replacing the original timestep embedding function and the schedule registration method with their patched counterparts.

Specifically, the function performs the following actions:
1. It assigns the `patched_timestep_embedding` function to `ldm_patched.ldm.modules.diffusionmodules.openaimodel.timestep_embedding`. This replacement ensures that the model uses a version of the timestep embedding that is consistent with the Kohya implementation, thereby minimizing discrepancies between model training and inference.
2. It assigns the `patched_register_schedule` method to `ldm_patched.modules.model_sampling.ModelSamplingDiscrete._register_schedule`. This modification allows the model to utilize a beta schedule that is tailored to enhance the diffusion process, ensuring that the model's sampling behavior aligns with the intended design.

The patch_all_precision function is called within the patch_all function, which serves as a central point for applying various patches across the model. By invoking patch_all_precision, the model benefits from the updated methods, leading to improved performance and consistency in generating outputs.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the patched methods are compatible with the existing model architecture. Users should verify that the model is properly configured to utilize these updates effectively.

**Output Example**: The function does not return a value; instead, it modifies the internal methods of the model. The expected outcome is that the model will now utilize the patched versions of the timestep embedding and schedule registration methods, enhancing its operational consistency.
