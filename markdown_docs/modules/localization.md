## FunctionDef localization_js(filename)
**localization_js**: The function of localization_js is to load localization data from a specified JSON file and prepare it for use in a JavaScript context.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· filename: A string representing the name of the localization file (without the .json extension) to be loaded.

**Code Description**: The localization_js function is designed to load localization data from a JSON file located in a predefined directory. It takes a single parameter, filename, which should be a string. The function constructs the full path to the JSON file by combining the localization_root directory with the provided filename and appending the '.json' extension. 

If the constructed file path exists, the function attempts to open the file with UTF-8 encoding. Upon successfully opening the file, it loads the contents into the global variable current_translation using the json.load method. The function then asserts that the loaded data is a dictionary and that both keys and values within this dictionary are strings. If any of these conditions are not met, an assertion error will be raised.

In the event of an exception during file loading or parsing, the function prints an error message indicating the failure to load the specified localization file. 

The function ultimately returns a JavaScript snippet that assigns the loaded localization data to a global JavaScript variable named window.localization, formatted as a JSON string. This allows the localization data to be accessed in the JavaScript context of a web application.

The localization_js function is called within the javascript_html function in the modules/ui_gradio_extensions.py file. Specifically, it is invoked with the argument args_manager.args.language, which indicates the desired language for localization. The output of localization_js is embedded within a script tag in the HTML head section, ensuring that the localization data is available for use in the web application's JavaScript environment.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the localization JSON file exists and is correctly formatted as a dictionary with string keys and values to avoid runtime errors.

**Output Example**: A possible appearance of the code's return value could be:
```javascript
window.localization = {"greeting": "Hello", "farewell": "Goodbye"};
```
## FunctionDef dump_english_config(components)
**dump_english_config**: The function of dump_english_config is to generate a JSON configuration file containing English localization strings from a list of component objects.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· components: A list of component objects from which localization strings are extracted.

**Code Description**: The dump_english_config function takes a list of components as input and processes each component to extract localization strings such as labels, values, information, and choices. It initializes an empty list called all_texts to store these strings. For each component in the components list, it attempts to retrieve the attributes 'label', 'value', 'choices', and 'info' using the getattr function. If these attributes are found and are of the appropriate type (string for label, value, and info; list for choices), they are appended to the all_texts list.

If the choices attribute is a list, the function further iterates through each choice. If a choice is a string, it is added to all_texts. If a choice is a tuple, the function iterates through the tuple and adds any string elements to all_texts. After collecting all relevant strings, the function constructs a dictionary called config_dict, where each key is a string from all_texts, excluding empty strings and any strings containing 'progress-container'.

The function then determines the full path for the output JSON file, which is named 'en.json' and is located in the localization_root directory. It opens this file in write mode with UTF-8 encoding and uses the json.dump function to write the config_dict to the file in a formatted manner (with an indentation of 4 spaces).

The function does not return any value upon completion.

This function is called by the dump_default_english_config function located in the webui.py module. The dump_default_english_config function imports dump_english_config and invokes it with grh.all_components as the argument. This indicates that dump_english_config is intended to be used as part of a larger process to generate default English localization configurations for the application.

**Note**: Ensure that the components passed to the dump_english_config function contain the necessary attributes (label, value, choices, info) to avoid potential errors during execution.

**Output Example**: A possible appearance of the code's return value in the 'en.json' file could be:
{
    "Welcome": "Welcome",
    "Exit": "Exit",
    "Settings": "Settings",
    "Choose an option": "Choose an option"
}
