**Code Description**: The AsyncTask class is designed to encapsulate all the parameters and settings required for processing asynchronous image generation and enhancement tasks. Upon initialization, it takes a list of arguments, which are then processed and assigned to various attributes of the class. This includes settings for prompts, model names, image dimensions, and various flags that control the behavior of the image processing pipeline.

The class is closely integrated with other components of the project, particularly the worker module, which utilizes AsyncTask instances to manage tasks. For example, the `get_task` function creates an instance of AsyncTask by passing the arguments it receives, while the `generate_clicked` function interacts with AsyncTask to manage the execution of tasks and handle the results. The AsyncTask class serves as a central point for managing the state and configuration of image processing tasks, ensuring that all necessary parameters are available for the worker functions to operate effectively.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the arguments passed to AsyncTask are in the correct order and format, as the class relies on the structure of these arguments to initialize its attributes properly. Additionally, any changes to the attributes after initialization should be done with caution to maintain the integrity of the processing pipeline.

**Output Example**: An example of the output from an AsyncTask instance might include a list of generated image paths, progress updates during processing, and any metadata associated with the images, such as the prompts used and the settings applied during generation.
### FunctionDef __init__(self, args)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize an instance of the AsyncTask class with specified parameters for processing tasks.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· args: A list of arguments that configure various settings and options for the AsyncTask instance.

**Code Description**: The __init__ method is the constructor for the AsyncTask class, responsible for setting up the initial state of an object based on the provided arguments. It begins by importing necessary modules and functions, including Performance, MetadataScheme, and get_enabled_loras, which are essential for configuring the task's performance and metadata handling.

The method first creates a copy of the input arguments and initializes several attributes to manage the task's state, such as yields, results, and flags for processing. If the args list is empty, the method returns early, indicating that no task configuration is available.

The method then processes the args list in reverse order, extracting various parameters that dictate the behavior of the AsyncTask instance. These parameters include options for image generation, prompts, performance selection, aspect ratios, output formats, and various processing flags. Notably, the performance_selection attribute is set using the Performance enumeration, which allows the task to adapt its processing based on the selected performance mode.

The method also initializes the performance_loras attribute by calling the get_enabled_loras function, which filters the Loras based on their enabled status and weight. This ensures that only valid Loras are considered for the task, which is critical for the image generation process.

Additionally, the method sets up control net tasks and enhancement controls based on the provided arguments, allowing for advanced image processing capabilities. The enhance_ctrls attribute is populated with configurations for enhancement tasks, ensuring that the AsyncTask instance is fully equipped to handle the specified operations.

Overall, the __init__ method establishes a comprehensive framework for the AsyncTask instance, ensuring that all necessary parameters are configured for effective processing. This method is crucial for the proper functioning of the AsyncTask class, as it lays the groundwork for subsequent operations and task execution.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the args list is structured correctly, as the method relies on the expected order and format of the arguments to initialize the AsyncTask instance accurately.

**Output Example**: An example of the possible state of an AsyncTask instance after initialization could include attributes such as:
```python
{
    'args': [...],
    'yields': [],
    'results': [],
    'performance_selection': Performance.QUALITY,
    'steps': 30,
    'loras': [('Lora1', 0.75), ('Lora2', 1.0)],
    'should_enhance': True,
    ...
}
```
***
## ClassDef EarlyReturnException
**EarlyReturnException**: The function of EarlyReturnException is to signal an early termination of a process in the event of a specific condition being met during execution.

**attributes**: The attributes of this Class.
· None

**Code Description**: The EarlyReturnException class is a custom exception that inherits from the built-in BaseException class in Python. It does not introduce any new attributes or methods; its primary purpose is to serve as a signal for early termination of a function or process. This exception is raised in scenarios where the execution flow needs to be interrupted, allowing the program to exit from a block of code prematurely without executing the remaining statements.

In the context of its usage, EarlyReturnException is specifically raised within the apply_inpaint function, which is part of the async_worker module. This function handles the inpainting process of images in an asynchronous task. During the execution of apply_inpaint, if the debugging_inpaint_preprocessor flag is set to true, the function yields the result of a visualization process and subsequently raises the EarlyReturnException. This indicates that the function should terminate early, effectively skipping any further processing that would normally follow.

The handler function, also located in the async_worker module, calls apply_inpaint and is designed to catch the EarlyReturnException. When this exception is caught, the handler function simply returns, indicating that the process has been halted as intended without proceeding to any further steps. This mechanism allows for a clean exit from the function when certain conditions are met, ensuring that unnecessary computations are avoided and resources are managed efficiently.

**Note**: It is important to handle the EarlyReturnException appropriately in any calling functions to ensure that the program can gracefully exit from the current execution context without causing unintended side effects or errors.
## FunctionDef worker
**worker**: The function of worker is to manage and execute asynchronous image processing tasks, including model preparation, prompt processing, and image generation.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· async_task: An instance of AsyncTask that contains all necessary information and parameters for processing the image generation task.

**Code Description**: The worker function is a central component of the asynchronous image processing system. It begins by importing necessary libraries and modules, including those for image manipulation, model management, and logging. The function retrieves the process ID and prints a message indicating that the worker has started.

The worker function is designed to handle multiple tasks related to image processing, including managing control nets, applying styles, and processing prompts. It defines several nested functions to facilitate specific operations such as updating progress bars, yielding results, building image walls, and processing tasks. Each of these nested functions serves a distinct purpose in the overall workflow.

The function initializes various parameters, including the dimensions of the images to be processed and the denoising strength. It also handles the loading of models and ensures that the correct models are available for processing. The function checks for user-defined settings, such as performance selection and whether to apply inpainting or upscaling.

The worker function processes prompts by calling the process_prompt function, which utilizes helper functions to clean and format the prompts, ensuring they are suitable for model input. It also manages the application of styles and wildcards, allowing for dynamic and varied prompt generation.

As the worker processes each task, it updates the progress and yields results back to the calling context. It handles exceptions and interruptions gracefully, allowing users to stop or skip tasks as needed. The function concludes by building an image wall if required and returning the final results.

The worker function is called within an infinite loop that continuously checks for new tasks in the async_tasks queue. This design allows it to handle multiple image processing requests concurrently, making it efficient for batch processing scenarios.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the async_task provided to the worker function is properly configured with all necessary parameters and that the required models are available for loading. The function assumes that the input images and prompts are correctly formatted to avoid runtime errors.

**Output Example**: The function does not return a value in the traditional sense; instead, it yields processed images and results back to the calling context. A possible appearance of the output could be a list of generated image paths or a summary of processing results, indicating the completion of tasks.
### FunctionDef progressbar(async_task, number, text)
**progressbar**: The function of progressbar is to update the progress of an asynchronous task with a specific message and current progress value.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· async_task: An object representing the asynchronous task that is being processed.
· number: An integer representing the current progress value to be displayed.
· text: A string message that describes the current operation being performed.

**Code Description**: The progressbar function is designed to provide feedback on the status of an ongoing asynchronous task. It takes three parameters: async_task, number, and text. The async_task parameter is an instance of an asynchronous task that contains information about the current operation. The number parameter indicates the current progress of the task, while the text parameter provides a descriptive message about what the task is currently doing.

When the function is called, it first prints a message to the console that includes the provided text, prefixed with "[Fooocus]". This serves as a notification to the user about the ongoing operation. Following this, the function appends a new entry to the yields list of the async_task object. This entry is a list that contains two elements: the string 'preview' and a tuple consisting of the number and text parameters, along with a None value. This structure allows other parts of the program to access the progress information and the associated message.

The progressbar function is called by several other functions within the project, such as yield_result, process_task, apply_vary, apply_inpaint, apply_upscale, process_prompt, and others. Each of these functions utilizes progressbar to report the status of various operations, such as checking for NSFW content, saving images, or processing prompts. This consistent use of the progressbar function ensures that users receive real-time updates on the progress of their tasks, enhancing the overall user experience.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the async_task object is properly initialized and that the yields list is accessible when calling the progressbar function. Additionally, the text parameter should be descriptive enough to provide meaningful context to the user regarding the current operation.
***
### FunctionDef yield_result(async_task, imgs, progressbar_index, black_out_nsfw, censor, do_not_show_finished_images)
**yield_result**: The function of yield_result is to process and store the results of an asynchronous task while optionally censoring images for NSFW content.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· async_task: An object representing the asynchronous task that is being processed.
· imgs: A list or a single image that needs to be processed and stored.
· progressbar_index: An integer representing the current progress value to be displayed.
· black_out_nsfw: A boolean indicating whether to censor NSFW content.
· censor: A boolean that determines if the images should be censored based on the NSFW settings.
· do_not_show_finished_images: A boolean that indicates whether to suppress the display of finished images.

**Code Description**: The yield_result function is designed to handle the results of an asynchronous task by processing images and updating the task's results. Initially, it checks if the imgs parameter is a list; if not, it converts it into a list to ensure consistent handling. 

If the censor parameter is set to True, and either the global configuration for NSFW content or the black_out_nsfw flag in the async_task is active, the function invokes the progressbar function to indicate that it is checking for NSFW content. Subsequently, it calls the default_censor function to process the images for NSFW content.

The processed images are then appended to the results attribute of the async_task object, which accumulates the results of the task. If the do_not_show_finished_images parameter is set to True, the function exits without further action, preventing the display of the finished images.

If the do_not_show_finished_images parameter is False, the function appends the current results to the yields list of the async_task, allowing other parts of the program to access the updated results. This design ensures that the function integrates smoothly with the overall asynchronous processing workflow.

The yield_result function is called by several other functions within the project, including process_task, apply_control_nets, apply_inpaint, and process_enhance. Each of these functions utilizes yield_result to report the status of various operations, such as saving images or processing enhancements. This consistent use of yield_result ensures that results are tracked and managed effectively throughout the asynchronous processing pipeline.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the async_task object is properly initialized and that the yields list is accessible when calling the yield_result function. Additionally, the imgs parameter should be in an appropriate format (either a list or a single image) to avoid unnecessary conversions.

**Output Example**: An example of the output when yield_result is called could be an updated async_task.results containing processed image paths, such as:
```
async_task.results = ['/path/to/image1.png', '/path/to/image2.png']
```
***
### FunctionDef build_image_wall(async_task)
**build_image_wall**: The function of build_image_wall is to create a composite image wall from a collection of images stored in an asynchronous task.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· async_task: An object that contains a list of image results to be processed.

**Code Description**: The build_image_wall function takes an async_task object as input, which is expected to have a results attribute that holds a list of image file paths or image arrays. The function first checks if the length of the results is less than two; if so, it exits early since at least two images are required to create a wall. 

Next, it iterates through the results, verifying that each item is either a valid file path (string) or a NumPy array. If the item is a string, it attempts to read the image using OpenCV and convert its color format from BGR to RGB. If the item is not a valid image (not a NumPy array or not a 3D array), the function returns without processing further.

Once valid images are collected, the function checks that all images have the same dimensions (height, width, and number of channels). If any image has different dimensions, the function exits.

The function then calculates the number of rows and columns needed to arrange the images in a grid format, based on the total number of images. It initializes a blank NumPy array (wall) to hold the composite image, with dimensions calculated from the individual image sizes and the number of rows and columns.

Finally, the function populates the wall array by placing each image in the appropriate position based on its row and column index. After constructing the wall, it appends the composite image to the results of the async_task, ensuring to use a deep copy to avoid performance issues with the Gradio interface. The function concludes without returning any value.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the images being processed are of the same size and format to avoid unexpected behavior. The function relies on the OpenCV library for image reading and processing, and NumPy for array manipulation.

**Output Example**: The output of the function will be a composite image wall, which is a single NumPy array representing the arranged images. For instance, if the input images are 100x100 pixels, and there are 4 images, the output will be a 200x200 pixel array (2 rows and 2 columns) containing the images arranged in a grid.
***

· total_count: An integer representing the total number of tasks to be processed.
· show_intermediate_results: A boolean flag indicating whether to display intermediate results during processing.
· persist_image: A boolean indicating whether to persist the generated images (default is True).

**Code Description**: The process_task function orchestrates the execution of an asynchronous image processing task by applying various transformations based on the provided parameters. Initially, it checks if the async_task has been interrupted and halts processing if necessary by calling the interrupt_current_processing function. 

If the goals include applying ControlNets, the function iterates through the specified ControlNet tasks, applying them to the positive and negative conditions using the apply_controlnet function. This integration allows for nuanced control over the image generation process based on the specified conditions.

The function then proceeds to generate images by invoking the process_diffusion function, which executes the diffusion process using the provided conditions, latent variables, and various parameters. The generated images are then processed further if inpainting is required, utilizing the current task's post-processing method.

After generating the images, the function calculates the current progress based on the preparation steps and total steps, updating the progress bar through the progressbar function. If NSFW content checking is enabled, it invokes the default_censor function to process the images accordingly.

Finally, the function saves the generated images and logs relevant metadata using the save_and_log function, yielding the results back to the async_task. The process_task function is called by other functions such as process_enhance and handler, which manage the overall workflow of processing tasks in an asynchronous manner. This highlights its role in the image generation pipeline, allowing for flexible configurations and refinements based on user-defined parameters.

**Note**: It is essential to ensure that all input parameters are correctly structured and that the models and conditions are compatible to avoid runtime errors during the processing. The use of the callback function and preview options should be configured based on user preferences.

**Output Example**: A possible return value from the process_task function might look like this:
```python
(imgs, img_paths, current_progress)
```
Where `imgs` is a list of generated images, `img_paths` is a list of paths to the saved images, and `current_progress` is an integer indicating the current progress percentage.
***
### FunctionDef apply_patch_settings(async_task)
**apply_patch_settings**: The function of apply_patch_settings is to configure and store patch processing settings based on the attributes of an asynchronous task.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· async_task: An object representing an asynchronous task that contains various settings related to image processing.

**Code Description**: The apply_patch_settings function is designed to take an async_task object as its parameter and utilize its attributes to create an instance of the PatchSettings class. This function specifically extracts the following attributes from the async_task: sharpness, adm_scaler_end, adm_scaler_positive, adm_scaler_negative, controlnet_softness, and adaptive_cfg. These attributes are essential for configuring the behavior of image processing algorithms, particularly in the context of adaptive diffusion models and ControlNet applications.

When invoked, apply_patch_settings assigns a new PatchSettings instance to a global dictionary called patch_settings, using a process identifier (pid) as the key. This indicates that the settings are stored in a way that associates them with a specific processing task, allowing for easy retrieval and management of settings during the execution of image processing tasks.

The apply_patch_settings function is called within the handler function, which manages the overall processing of an async_task. The handler function prepares the async_task, sets various parameters, and then calls apply_patch_settings to ensure that the appropriate patch settings are applied before proceeding with further processing steps. This relationship highlights the importance of apply_patch_settings in establishing the configuration needed for subsequent operations in the image processing workflow.

**Note**: When using the apply_patch_settings function, it is crucial to ensure that the async_task object is properly initialized and contains valid values for the attributes being accessed. Any discrepancies in these values may lead to unintended behavior in the image processing tasks that rely on the configured settings.
***
### FunctionDef save_and_log(async_task, height, imgs, task, use_expansion, width, loras, persist_image)
**save_and_log**: The function of save_and_log is to process a list of images, log relevant metadata about the image generation task, and return the paths of the saved images.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· async_task: An object representing the asynchronous task containing various settings and configurations for image generation.
· height: An integer representing the height of the generated images.
· imgs: A list of images that have been generated during the task.
· task: A dictionary containing task-specific information, including prompts and seed values.
· use_expansion: A boolean indicating whether to use prompt expansion in the logging process.
· width: An integer representing the width of the generated images.
· loras: A list of tuples containing LoRA names and their corresponding weights.
· persist_image: A boolean indicating whether to persist the generated images (default is True).

**Code Description**: The save_and_log function iterates over a list of generated images (imgs) and constructs a detailed log for each image. It creates a list of tuples (d) that contains various metadata attributes related to the image generation process, such as prompts, model names, performance metrics, and configuration settings. 

For each image, the function checks the properties of the async_task object to determine which metadata to include. It appends relevant information to the list d, including prompts, model names, resolution, guidance scale, and any additional settings like LoRA configurations and metadata scheme. If the async_task has the save_metadata_to_images attribute set to true, it initializes a MetadataParser instance using the get_metadata_parser function, which selects the appropriate parser based on the specified metadata scheme.

The set_data method of the MetadataParser is called to populate the parser with the relevant metadata attributes before logging the image. The function then calls the log function, which is responsible for saving the image and its associated metadata, and appends the resulting image path to the img_paths list.

The save_and_log function is called within the process_task function, which handles the overall workflow of processing an image generation task. After generating images, process_task invokes save_and_log to log the results and save the images, ensuring that all relevant metadata is captured and stored.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the async_task object is properly configured with valid model names and settings to avoid errors during the logging process. Additionally, the loras parameter should be structured as a list of tuples to prevent runtime errors during iteration.

**Output Example**: A possible return value from the save_and_log function might look like this:
```python
['/path/to/saved/image1.png', '/path/to/saved/image2.png', ...]
```
***
### FunctionDef apply_control_nets(async_task, height, ip_adapter_face_path, ip_adapter_path, width, current_progress)
**apply_control_nets**: The function of apply_control_nets is to preprocess images for various control net tasks, ensuring that they are correctly formatted and ready for further processing.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· async_task: An object representing the asynchronous task that contains control net tasks and related configurations.
· height: An integer representing the target height to resize images.
· ip_adapter_face_path: A string specifying the path to the IP adapter configuration for face images.
· ip_adapter_path: A string specifying the path to the IP adapter configuration for general images.
· width: An integer representing the target width to resize images.
· current_progress: An integer indicating the current progress of the asynchronous task.

**Code Description**: The apply_control_nets function is designed to process images associated with various control net tasks within an asynchronous workflow. It begins by iterating through different categories of control net tasks defined in the async_task object, specifically focusing on tasks related to Canny edge detection, CPDS (Color-Preserved Decolorization), and IP (Image Projection) adapters.

For each task in the Canny edge detection category, the function retrieves the image and resizes it to the specified width and height using the resize_image function. If the skipping flag for the Canny preprocessor is not set, it applies the canny_pyramid function to perform multi-scale Canny edge detection on the image. The processed image is then converted to a PyTorch tensor using the numpy_to_pytorch function, making it suitable for further neural network operations. If debugging is enabled, the function yields the result for inspection.

Similarly, for tasks in the CPDS category, the function resizes the images and applies the cpds function to enhance contrast and normalize the results. The processed images are also converted to PyTorch tensors and yielded if debugging is enabled.

For tasks related to the IP adapter, the function resizes the images to a fixed size of 224x224 pixels and processes them using the preprocess function from the IP adapter module. This step prepares the images for projection models. Again, if debugging is enabled, the results are yielded for review.

Finally, the function checks if there are any IP tasks and, if present, applies the patch_model function to modify the final Unet model of the pipeline based on the processed tasks. This integration allows for dynamic adjustments to the model's attention mechanisms based on the specific tasks being processed.

The apply_control_nets function is called within the handler function of the async_worker module, specifically when the goals of the asynchronous task include control net processing. This highlights its role in the broader context of image processing workflows, where it ensures that images are correctly preprocessed and ready for subsequent operations.

**Note**: It is essential to ensure that the input images are in the correct format and that the specified paths for the IP adapters are valid. The function relies on the proper initialization of the async_task object and its associated attributes to function correctly.
***
### FunctionDef apply_vary(async_task, uov_method, denoising_strength, uov_input_image, switch, current_progress, advance_progress)
**apply_vary**: The function of apply_vary is to process an input image by adjusting its denoising strength and encoding it using a Variational Autoencoder (VAE).

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· async_task: An object representing the asynchronous task that is being processed, containing various attributes related to the task.
· uov_method: A string indicating the method used for the image processing, which can influence the denoising strength.

**Code Description**: The apply_vary function begins by adjusting the denoising strength based on the specified uov_method. If the method includes 'subtle', the denoising strength is set to 0.5, and if it includes 'strong', it is set to 0.85. If the async_task has an overwrite_vary_strength greater than 0, this value overrides the previously set denoising strength.

Next, the function calculates the shape ceiling for the input image using the get_image_shape_ceil function, ensuring that the image dimensions are appropriate for processing. If the calculated shape is less than 1024, it is resized to 1024, and if it exceeds 2048, it is resized to 2048. The set_image_shape_ceil function is then called to adjust the image dimensions to the determined shape ceiling.

The image is converted from a NumPy array to a PyTorch tensor using the numpy_to_pytorch function, which prepares it for encoding. If the advance_progress flag is set to True, the current progress is incremented.

The function then updates the progress bar using the progressbar function, indicating that VAE encoding is in progress. It retrieves a candidate VAE model using the get_candidate_vae function, which selects the appropriate model based on the async_task parameters. The input image is then encoded into a latent representation using the encode_vae function.

Finally, the function extracts the dimensions of the encoded samples, calculates the final resolution of the processed image, and returns the modified input image, denoising strength, initial latent representation, final width, height, and current progress.

The apply_vary function is called within the process_enhance function, which manages various image processing tasks, including varying, upscaling, and inpainting. This integration highlights the function's role in the overall workflow, ensuring that images are processed correctly based on the specified goals.

**Note**: It is essential to ensure that the input image is a valid NumPy array and that the parameters provided to the function are correctly set to avoid errors during execution.

**Output Example**: A possible return value of the function could be:
(uov_input_image, denoising_strength, initial_latent, width, height, current_progress)
where uov_input_image is the processed image, denoising_strength is the applied strength, initial_latent is the encoded representation, width and height are the final dimensions of the image, and current_progress is the updated progress value.

### FunctionDef apply_inpaint(async_task, initial_latent, inpaint_head_model_path, inpaint_image, inpaint_mask, inpaint_parameterized, denoising_strength, inpaint_respective_field, switch, inpaint_disable_initial_latent, current_progress, skip_apply_outpaint, advance_progress)
**apply_inpaint**: The function of apply_inpaint is to manage the inpainting process of an image using specified parameters, including the image, mask, and various inpainting settings.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· async_task: An object representing the asynchronous task that is being processed, containing state and parameters for the inpainting operation.  
· initial_latent: A dictionary that holds the initial latent representation of the image, which may be modified during the inpainting process.  
· inpaint_head_model_path: A string representing the file path to the inpainting head model that will be used for processing.  
· inpaint_image: A NumPy array representing the image that is to be inpainted.  
· inpaint_mask: A NumPy array representing the mask that indicates the areas of the image to be inpainted.  
· inpaint_parameterized: A boolean flag indicating whether the inpainting process should use parameterized settings.  
· denoising_strength: A float value that controls the level of denoising applied during the inpainting process.  
· inpaint_respective_field: A parameter that influences the inpainting operation, typically related to the area of interest in the image.  
· switch: An integer that may control the behavior of the inpainting process based on specific conditions.  
· inpaint_disable_initial_latent: A boolean flag indicating whether to disable the use of the initial latent representation during inpainting.  
· current_progress: An integer representing the current progress of the inpainting operation, which may be updated during execution.  
· skip_apply_outpaint: A boolean flag that determines whether to skip the outpainting step before inpainting.  
· advance_progress: A boolean flag indicating whether to advance the progress counter during the operation.

**Code Description**: The apply_inpaint function orchestrates the inpainting workflow by first checking if outpainting should be applied based on the skip_apply_outpaint parameter. If outpainting is not skipped, it calls the apply_outpaint function to modify the inpaint_image and inpaint_mask accordingly. 

Next, an instance of the InpaintWorker class is created, which is responsible for handling the inpainting operations. The function sets the current task of the inpaint_worker to this new instance, passing the necessary parameters such as the image, mask, denoising strength, and respective field. If debugging is enabled, the function yields the result of a visualization process and raises an EarlyReturnException to terminate further processing.

The function then advances the current progress if the advance_progress flag is set and updates the progress bar to indicate the ongoing VAE (Variational Autoencoder) inpainting encoding. It retrieves candidate VAE models by calling the get_candidate_vae function, which selects the appropriate models based on the provided parameters.

The function proceeds to encode the inpaint image and mask using the encode_vae_inpaint function, which generates latent representations for the inpainting operation. If a candidate VAE swap is available, it encodes the fill pixels as well. The function loads the latent representations into the inpaint_worker instance and applies the inpainting model if parameterized settings are enabled.

Finally, the function checks if the initial latent representation should be disabled and prepares the final output, including the denoising strength, updated initial latent, width, height, and current progress. This structured approach ensures that the inpainting process is executed efficiently and effectively, integrating various components of the image processing pipeline.

The apply_inpaint function is called by other functions, such as process_enhance and handler, which manage the overall image enhancement workflow. This highlights its role in the broader context of image processing, where it serves as a critical step in applying inpainting techniques to improve image quality.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the input image and mask are correctly formatted and that the parameters passed to the function are valid to avoid runtime errors. Additionally, the use of the skip_apply_outpaint and advance_progress flags should be considered based on the desired workflow.

**Output Example**: A possible return value of the function could be a tuple containing the updated denoising strength, initial latent representation, width, height, and current progress, such as:
```
(0.8, {'samples': updated_latent}, 64, 64, 5)
```

### FunctionDef apply_outpaint(async_task, inpaint_image, inpaint_mask)
**apply_outpaint**: The function of apply_outpaint is to modify the input image and mask by applying padding based on specified outpaint selections.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· async_task: An object that contains the current task's state and parameters, including outpaint selections.
· inpaint_image: A NumPy array representing the image to be inpainted.
· inpaint_mask: A NumPy array representing the mask corresponding to the inpaint_image.

**Code Description**: The apply_outpaint function is designed to adjust the dimensions of an input image and its corresponding mask based on the selections made in the async_task object. It checks if there are any outpaint selections specified in async_task.outpaint_selections. If selections are present, the function retrieves the height (H), width (W), and channel count (C) of the inpaint_image.

The function then applies padding to the inpaint_image and inpaint_mask based on the specified selections: 
- If 'top' is selected, it pads the top of the image and mask with edge values and constant values, respectively.
- If 'bottom' is selected, it pads the bottom similarly.
- If 'left' is selected, it pads the left side, and if 'right' is selected, it pads the right side.

After applying the necessary padding, the function ensures that both inpaint_image and inpaint_mask are contiguous in memory. It also sets the inpaint_strength and inpaint_respective_field attributes of the async_task to 1.0, indicating full strength for the inpainting process.

Finally, the function returns the modified inpaint_image and inpaint_mask, which are then utilized in the apply_inpaint function. The apply_inpaint function calls apply_outpaint to preprocess the image and mask before proceeding with further inpainting operations, such as encoding and applying the inpainting model. This relationship highlights the importance of apply_outpaint in preparing the data for subsequent processing steps.

**Note**: It is essential to ensure that the async_task object has valid outpaint selections before calling this function, as the absence of selections will result in no modifications to the input image and mask.

**Output Example**: A possible return value of the function could be two NumPy arrays representing the padded inpaint_image and inpaint_mask, where the dimensions of the arrays have been increased according to the specified outpaint selections. For instance, if the original inpaint_image was of shape (256, 256, 3) and 'top' and 'left' were selected, the returned inpaint_image might have a shape of (332, 256, 3) after padding.
***
### FunctionDef apply_upscale(async_task, uov_input_image, uov_method, switch, current_progress, advance_progress)
**apply_upscale**: The function of apply_upscale is to upscale an input image using specified methods and manage the associated processing steps.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· async_task: An object representing the asynchronous task that is being processed.
· uov_input_image: A NumPy array representing the input image to be upscaled.
· uov_method: A string indicating the upscaling method to be used.
· switch: An integer that may control certain processing behaviors.
· current_progress: An integer representing the current progress of the task.
· advance_progress: A boolean flag indicating whether to increment the current progress.

**Code Description**: The apply_upscale function is designed to handle the upscaling of an image while providing feedback on the progress of the operation. It begins by extracting the height (H), width (W), and number of channels (C) from the input image's shape. If the advance_progress flag is set to True, it increments the current_progress by 1. The function then calls progressbar to update the user on the upscaling process, indicating the original dimensions of the image.

The function proceeds to upscale the image using the perform_upscale function, which is responsible for applying a pre-trained model to the input image. After the image is upscaled, the function checks the specified uov_method to determine the scaling factor (f). It calculates the new dimensions of the image and uses the get_shape_ceil function to ensure that the dimensions meet specific constraints. If the calculated shape is less than 1024, it resizes the image to have a minimum dimension of 1024 using the set_image_shape_ceil function. Otherwise, it resamples the image to the new dimensions using the resample_image function.

The function also evaluates whether the upscaled image is too large for further processing. If the image is deemed "super large" or if the uov_method indicates a "fast" processing mode, the function prepares to return the upscaled image directly without further processing. If not, it continues with the encoding process using a Variational Autoencoder (VAE). It retrieves the appropriate VAE model using the get_candidate_vae function and encodes the image using the encode_vae function.

Finally, the function returns a tuple containing information about whether the image was directly returned, the upscaled image, the denoising strength, the initial latent representation, and the new dimensions of the image, along with the updated progress.

The apply_upscale function is called within the process_enhance function, which manages various image processing tasks. It is specifically invoked when the goals include upscaling the image. The results from apply_upscale are used to determine the next steps in the processing pipeline, including potential checks for NSFW content and saving the processed image.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the input image is in the correct format (a NumPy array) and that the specified uov_method is valid. The function is designed to handle various upscaling methods, and the quality of the output will depend on the chosen method and the characteristics of the input image.

**Output Example**: A possible appearance of the code's return value could be a tuple such as (False, upscaled_image, 0.382, initial_latent, True, 1792, 1280, 3), where upscaled_image is a NumPy array representing the upscaled image, initial_latent is a dictionary containing the latent representation, and the other values represent processing flags and dimensions.
***
### FunctionDef apply_overrides(async_task, steps, height, width)
**apply_overrides**: The function of apply_overrides is to adjust the parameters of an asynchronous task based on specified overrides.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· async_task: An object representing the asynchronous task, which contains various attributes that may dictate how the task should be executed.
· steps: An integer representing the number of steps to be taken in the task.
· height: An integer representing the height dimension of the task.
· width: An integer representing the width dimension of the task.

**Code Description**: The apply_overrides function modifies the parameters of an asynchronous task based on the attributes of the async_task object. It first checks if the async_task has a specified overwrite_step; if so, it updates the steps variable accordingly. Next, it calculates a switch value based on the product of the async_task's steps and refiner_switch attribute, rounding it to the nearest integer. If an overwrite_switch is specified, it overrides the calculated switch value. The function also checks for any specified overwrite values for width and height, updating these dimensions if necessary. Finally, the function returns the potentially modified values of steps, switch, width, and height.

This function is called within other functions, such as enhance_upscale and handler, which are responsible for processing images and managing tasks. In enhance_upscale, apply_overrides is used to adjust the steps and dimensions before proceeding with the enhancement process. Similarly, in the handler function, it is called to set the initial parameters for the task based on the async_task attributes. The adjustments made by apply_overrides ensure that the task is executed with the correct parameters, allowing for flexibility in how tasks are processed based on user-defined settings.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the async_task object is properly initialized and contains the necessary attributes before calling this function to avoid unexpected behavior.

**Output Example**: A possible return value from the apply_overrides function could be (10, 5, 1920, 1080), indicating that the steps have been set to 10, the switch to 5, and the dimensions have been adjusted to a width of 1920 and a height of 1080.

· use_synthetic_refiner: A boolean indicating whether to use a synthetic refiner model.
· current_progress: An integer representing the current progress of the task.
· advance_progress: A boolean indicating whether to advance the progress counter during processing (default is False).

**Code Description**: The process_prompt function is responsible for processing the main and negative prompts for image generation tasks. It begins by sanitizing the input prompts using the safe_str function to ensure they are clean and free of excessive whitespace. The function then splits the prompts into individual lines and filters out any empty strings using the remove_empty_str function. If the main prompt is empty, it disables the use of expansion, as an empty prompt would not be meaningful.

The function then manages the progress of the task, updating the current progress and displaying messages using the progressbar function. It processes LoRA references from the prompt using the parse_lora_references_from_prompt function, which extracts valid LoRA references while managing their limits and deduplication.

Next, the function refreshes the models and configurations necessary for processing by calling the refresh_everything function. It sets the clip skip value using the set_clip_skip function, ensuring that the model layers are configured correctly.

The function then prepares a list of tasks for image generation. For each image to be generated, it calculates the seed value based on the current task's seed and whether seed incrementing is disabled. It applies wildcards and arrays to the prompts using the apply_wildcards and apply_arrays functions, respectively, to create variations of the prompts.

The function also handles the application of styles to the prompts using the apply_style function, which modifies the positive prompts based on selected styles. It constructs the final task dictionary for each image, including the processed prompts, seeds, and other relevant information.

If expansion is enabled, the function generates expanded prompts using the pipeline's final_expansion method. It encodes the positive and negative prompts using the pipeline's clip_encode function, storing the encoded representations in the task dictionary.

Finally, the function returns a tuple containing the list of tasks, the use_expansion flag, the list of LoRA references, and the current progress value. This structured output allows for further processing in the image generation workflow.

The process_prompt function is called by various other functions within the project, including process_enhance and handler. It plays a critical role in preparing the prompts and managing configurations before the actual image generation tasks are executed.

**Note**: When using process_prompt, it is essential to ensure that the input prompts are well-formed and that all necessary configurations are set in the async_task object. The function assumes that the models and resources required for processing are properly initialized and available.

**Output Example**: A possible return value from process_prompt could look like this:
```
(
    [
        {
            'task_seed': 42,
            'task_prompt': 'A beautiful sunset over the mountains.',
            'task_negative_prompt': 'No people.',
            'positive': ['A beautiful sunset over the mountains.'],
            'negative': ['No people.'],
            'expansion': '',
            'c': None,
            'uc': None,
            'positive_top_k': 1,
            'negative_top_k': 1,
            'log_positive_prompt': 'A beautiful sunset over the mountains.',
            'log_negative_prompt': 'No people.',
            'styles': []

### FunctionDef apply_freeu(async_task)
**apply_freeu**: The function of apply_freeu is to enable and apply the FreeU feature to the final UNet model using parameters from the async_task.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· async_task: An object containing various attributes related to the asynchronous task, including FreeU parameters.

**Code Description**: The apply_freeu function is responsible for integrating the FreeU feature into the final UNet model within a processing pipeline. When invoked, it first prints a message indicating that FreeU is enabled. It then calls the core.apply_freeu function, passing the current state of the pipeline's final_unet along with several parameters extracted from the async_task object: freeu_b1, freeu_b2, freeu_s1, and freeu_s2. These parameters are essential for configuring the FreeU functionality, which likely modifies the behavior or performance of the UNet model during image processing tasks.

The apply_freeu function is called within the process_enhance function, which orchestrates various image enhancement tasks based on the goals specified in the async_task. Specifically, if the async_task indicates that FreeU is enabled (async_task.freeu_enabled), the apply_freeu function is executed to apply the necessary modifications to the final UNet model before proceeding with other enhancement tasks. This integration ensures that the FreeU feature is seamlessly incorporated into the overall processing workflow, allowing for enhanced image processing capabilities.

Additionally, the apply_freeu function is also invoked in the handler function, which manages the preparation and execution of asynchronous tasks. This highlights its importance in the broader context of the application, as it ensures that the FreeU feature is applied consistently across different stages of task processing.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the async_task object is properly configured with the necessary FreeU parameters before invoking the apply_freeu function, as the absence of these parameters may lead to unexpected behavior or errors during processing.
***
### FunctionDef patch_discrete(unet, scheduler_name)
**patch_discrete**: The function of patch_discrete is to apply a discrete sampling patch to a given UNet model using a specified scheduler name.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· unet: An instance of the UNet model that will be modified by the patching process.  
· scheduler_name: A string that specifies the name of the scheduler to be used for the patching operation.

**Code Description**: The patch_discrete function serves as a wrapper that invokes the patch method from the core.opModelSamplingDiscrete module. It takes two arguments: a UNet model and a scheduler name. The function calls the patch method with these parameters and a fixed boolean value of False, which indicates that the sigma values should not be rescaled based on the zero terminal signal-to-noise ratio.

The patch method modifies the sampling strategy of the provided UNet model by integrating different sampling types and adjusting the sigma values according to the specified parameters. The patch_discrete function returns the modified model, which now incorporates the new sampling strategy defined by the scheduler name.

This function is called within the patch_samplers function located in the same module. In patch_samplers, the scheduler name is evaluated, and if it matches certain conditions (specifically 'lcm' or 'tcd'), the patch_discrete function is invoked to apply the corresponding modifications to the final_unet and final_refiner_unet models in the pipeline. This demonstrates how patch_discrete is integrated into a broader workflow, allowing for dynamic adjustments of model configurations based on the selected sampling strategies.

**Note**: It is essential to ensure that the unet model and scheduler_name are correctly specified when using the patch_discrete function to avoid potential runtime errors. The behavior of the patching process may vary depending on the scheduler name provided.

**Output Example**: A possible output of the patch_discrete function could be a modified UNet model instance that incorporates the specified sampling strategy, such as:
```python
modified_unet = patch_discrete(original_unet, "lcm")
```
***
### FunctionDef patch_edm(unet, scheduler_name)
**patch_edm**: The function of patch_edm is to apply advanced sampling strategies to a given unet model using specified parameters.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· parameter1: unet - The model instance that will be modified with new sampling strategies.  
· parameter2: scheduler_name - A string that specifies the type of scheduler to be used, which influences the sampling process.

**Code Description**: The patch_edm function serves as a wrapper that invokes the core functionality of the patch method from the ModelSamplingContinuousEDM class. It takes two parameters: a unet model and a scheduler name. The function calls the patch method with the unet model, the scheduler name, and two fixed sigma values: 120.0 for sigma_max and 0.002 for sigma_min. 

The patch method is responsible for configuring and applying model sampling strategies based on the provided parameters. It clones the unet model to ensure that the original model remains unchanged. The method then determines the appropriate sampling strategy based on the scheduler name provided. This integration allows for the application of advanced sampling strategies tailored to the unet model, enhancing its performance during the sampling process.

The patch_edm function is called within the patch_samplers function, which is part of the async_worker module. In patch_samplers, if the scheduler name is 'edm_playground_v2.5', the function invokes patch_edm for both the final_unet and final_refiner_unet models, ensuring that these models are updated with the new sampling strategies before proceeding with the rest of the scheduling logic.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the unet model passed to patch_edm is compatible with the sampling strategies being applied. The sigma_max and sigma_min values are fixed in this context, and any changes to these values should be made with caution, as they directly affect the noise levels used in the sampling process.

**Output Example**: A possible output of the patch_edm function could be a modified unet model instance that incorporates the specified sampling strategy and parameters, resulting in improved performance during the sampling process. For instance, if the input model is a neural network designed for image generation, the output might be a new model capable of generating images with enhanced noise handling based on the selected sampling method.
***
### FunctionDef patch_samplers(async_task)
**patch_samplers**: The function of patch_samplers is to modify the sampling strategy of UNet models based on the scheduler name specified in the async_task.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· async_task: An instance of AsyncTask that contains the scheduler name and references to the UNet models that may be patched.

**Code Description**: The patch_samplers function is designed to adjust the sampling strategies of the final UNet models within a pipeline based on the scheduler name provided in the async_task. The function begins by retrieving the scheduler name from the async_task object. It then evaluates this scheduler name against specific conditions to determine the appropriate modifications to apply.

If the scheduler name is either 'lcm' or 'tcd', the function sets the final scheduler name to 'sgm_uniform'. It checks if the final_unet and final_refiner_unet models in the pipeline are not None. If they are valid, it invokes the patch_discrete function, passing the respective UNet model and the original scheduler name. The patch_discrete function applies a discrete sampling patch to the UNet model, modifying its sampling strategy accordingly.

In the case where the scheduler name is 'edm_playground_v2.5', the function changes the final scheduler name to 'karras'. Similar to the previous condition, it checks the validity of the final_unet and final_refiner_unet models. If they are present, it calls the patch_edm function with the models and the scheduler name. The patch_edm function applies advanced sampling strategies to the UNet models, enhancing their performance during the sampling process.

The function concludes by returning the final scheduler name, which reflects the modifications made based on the initial scheduler name.

The patch_samplers function is called within the process_enhance and handler functions. In process_enhance, it is invoked to ensure that the appropriate sampling strategies are applied before further processing of the image enhancement tasks. In the handler function, it is called during the initialization phase to set up the correct sampling strategy based on the async_task's parameters.

**Note**: It is essential to ensure that the async_task contains a valid scheduler name and that the UNet models are properly initialized to avoid runtime errors during the patching process.

**Output Example**: A possible output of the patch_samplers function could be the final scheduler name that has been determined based on the input conditions, such as:
```python
final_scheduler_name = patch_samplers(async_task)
```
***
### FunctionDef set_hyper_sd_defaults(async_task, current_progress, advance_progress)
**set_hyper_sd_defaults**: The function of set_hyper_sd_defaults is to configure the default settings for the Hyper SD mode in an asynchronous task.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· async_task: An object representing the asynchronous task that is being processed.
· current_progress: An integer representing the current progress value of the task.
· advance_progress: A boolean flag indicating whether to increment the current progress by one.

**Code Description**: The set_hyper_sd_defaults function is designed to set specific default configurations for an asynchronous task when operating in Hyper SD mode. Upon invocation, the function first prints a message indicating the entry into Hyper-SD mode. If the advance_progress parameter is set to True, the function increments the current_progress by one. 

Next, it calls the progressbar function, which updates the user interface to reflect the current progress of downloading Hyper-SD components, providing feedback to the user about the ongoing operation. The function then appends a new entry to the performance_loras list of the async_task object, which includes the result of the downloading_sdxl_hyper_sd_lora function, indicating that the Hyper SD model will be utilized in the current operation.

The function also checks if the refiner_model_name of the async_task is not set to 'None'. If it is not, it disables the refiner by setting the refiner_model_name to 'None' and prints a message indicating that the refiner has been disabled in Hyper-SD mode. Subsequently, it configures several other parameters of the async_task, such as sampler_name, scheduler_name, sharpness, cfg_scale, adaptive_cfg, refiner_switch, and various ADM scalers, all of which are set to specific default values relevant to Hyper SD mode.

Finally, the function returns the updated current_progress value, which reflects the progress made during the setup of the Hyper SD mode.

The set_hyper_sd_defaults function is called within the handler function, which manages the overall processing of an async_task. Depending on the performance_selection attribute of the async_task, the handler function determines whether to invoke set_hyper_sd_defaults, along with other configuration functions like set_lcm_defaults and set_lightning_defaults. This structured approach allows for flexible configuration of the async_task based on user-selected performance modes.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the async_task object is properly initialized and that the performance_loras list is accessible when calling the set_hyper_sd_defaults function. Additionally, users should verify that the necessary components for Hyper SD mode are available and that the downloading_sdxl_hyper_sd_lora function executes successfully to avoid any interruptions in the task.

**Output Example**: A possible return value from the function could be the integer value representing the updated current_progress, indicating the progress made in setting up the Hyper SD mode, such as returning a value of 1 if the progress was incremented.

### FunctionDef set_lightning_defaults(async_task, current_progress, advance_progress)
**set_lightning_defaults**: The function of set_lightning_defaults is to configure the parameters of an asynchronous task for optimal performance in Lightning mode.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· async_task: An object representing the asynchronous task that is being processed.
· current_progress: An integer representing the current progress value of the task.
· advance_progress: A boolean indicating whether to increment the current progress by one.

**Code Description**: The set_lightning_defaults function is designed to set specific configurations for an asynchronous task when it operates in Lightning mode. Upon invocation, the function begins by printing a message indicating that it has entered Lightning mode. If the advance_progress parameter is set to True, the function increments the current_progress value by one.

Next, the function calls the progressbar function, which updates the user interface to reflect that the task is downloading Lightning components. This is done by passing the async_task, a fixed progress value of 1, and a descriptive message.

The function then proceeds to download the necessary Lightning components by invoking the downloading_sdxl_lightning_lora function from the modules.config module. The result of this function call, which is the filename of the downloaded model, is appended to the performance_loras list of the async_task object, indicating that the model is now part of the performance configurations for the task.

Additionally, the function checks if the refiner_model_name attribute of the async_task is not set to 'None'. If it is not, the function disables the refiner by setting this attribute to 'None' and prints a message to inform the user. The function then sets various other parameters of the async_task object, including sampler_name, scheduler_name, sharpness, cfg_scale, adaptive_cfg, refiner_switch, and various ADM scalers, to predefined values that are optimal for Lightning mode.

Finally, the function returns the updated current_progress value, which reflects the state of the task after the configurations have been applied.

The set_lightning_defaults function is called by the handler function within the same module. The handler function determines the performance selection of the async_task and calls set_lightning_defaults when the performance selection is set to Performance.LIGHTNING. This establishes a clear relationship where the handler function orchestrates the overall task processing and delegates specific configuration tasks to set_lightning_defaults.

**Note**: It is essential to ensure that the async_task object is properly initialized and that its attributes are accessible when calling set_lightning_defaults. The advance_progress parameter should be used judiciously to reflect the correct progress state of the task.

**Output Example**: A possible return value from the function could be an integer representing the updated current progress, such as 1, indicating that the task has progressed to the next stage after setting the Lightning defaults.

### FunctionDef set_lcm_defaults(async_task, current_progress, advance_progress)
**set_lcm_defaults**: The function of set_lcm_defaults is to configure the asynchronous task for Low Complexity Model (LCM) mode by setting various parameters and downloading necessary components.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· async_task: An object representing the asynchronous task that is being processed.
· current_progress: An integer representing the current progress of the task.
· advance_progress: A boolean indicating whether to increment the current progress.

**Code Description**: The set_lcm_defaults function is designed to prepare an asynchronous task for execution in LCM mode. It begins by printing a message to indicate that LCM mode has been entered. If the advance_progress parameter is set to True, the function increments the current_progress by 1 to reflect the advancement in task processing.

The function then calls the progressbar function to update the user interface, indicating that LCM components are being downloaded. It utilizes the downloading_sdxl_lcm_lora function from the modules.config module to download the necessary model file, which is appended to the performance_loras list of the async_task object with a weight of 1.0.

Subsequently, the function checks if the refiner_model_name of the async_task is not set to 'None'. If it is not, it disables the refiner by setting the refiner_model_name to 'None' and prints a message indicating that the refiner is disabled in LCM mode. The function then sets various parameters related to the LCM mode, including sampler_name, scheduler_name, sharpness, cfg_scale, adaptive_cfg, and several ADM scalers, all of which are essential for the proper functioning of the task in LCM mode.

Finally, the function returns the updated current_progress, which reflects the state of the task after the configuration changes have been applied.

The set_lcm_defaults function is called within the handler function when the performance_selection of the async_task is set to Performance.EXTREME_SPEED. This indicates that the task is being prepared for execution with the LCM settings, ensuring that all necessary components are in place for optimal performance.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the async_task object is properly initialized and that the downloading_sdxl_lcm_lora function is accessible within the scope of set_lcm_defaults.

**Code Description**: The apply_image_input function is responsible for managing and preparing image data for various processing tasks based on the current state of the async_task. It begins by checking the current tab of the async_task to determine if it should process an upscale operation or an inpainting operation. If the current tab is 'uov' or if it is 'ip' and mixing image prompts with upscale, it prepares the image for upscaling using the prepare_upscale function. This function modifies the input image and updates the processing steps accordingly.

Next, if the current tab is 'inpaint' or if it is 'ip' and mixing image prompts with inpainting, the function processes the inpainting image and mask. It handles advanced masking options, including resampling the mask image and applying morphological operations such as erosion or dilation based on user settings. The function also checks if the inpainting is parameterized, and if so, it downloads the necessary inpainting models using the downloading_inpaint_models function. This ensures that the required models are available for the inpainting task.

Furthermore, the function manages the downloading of control models if the current task involves controlnet operations. It calls the downloading_controlnet_canny, downloading_controlnet_cpds, and downloading_ip_adapters functions to ensure that the necessary models are downloaded based on the current task requirements.

Lastly, if the current tab is 'enhance' and an enhance input image is provided, the function prepares the image for enhancement and sets the skip_prompt_processing flag to true. The function ultimately returns a tuple containing updated paths and flags that reflect the current state of the processing.

The apply_image_input function is called within the handler function of the async_worker module. It is invoked when the async_task has an input image checkbox checked, indicating that image processing is required. This establishes a clear relationship between the handler and the apply_image_input function, as the handler manages the overall processing flow and delegates specific tasks to apply_image_input.

**Note**: It is essential to ensure that all paths and parameters provided to the function are valid and accessible. Users should also verify that the necessary models are available for download and that the async_task is correctly initialized to avoid runtime errors.

**Output Example**: A possible return value from the function could be a tuple containing updated paths and flags, such as:
(base_model_additional_loras, "/path/to/clip_vision_model", "/path/to/controlnet_canny_model", "/path/to/controlnet_cpds_model", "/path/to/inpaint_head_model", inpaint_image, inpaint_mask, "/path/to/ip_adapter_face", "/path/to/ip_adapter", "/path/to/ip_negative", skip_prompt_processing, use_synthetic_refiner).
***
### FunctionDef prepare_upscale(async_task, goals, uov_input_image, uov_method, performance, steps, current_progress, advance_progress, skip_prompt_processing)
**prepare_upscale**: The function of prepare_upscale is to prepare an input image for upscaling by processing it according to specified methods and performance parameters.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· async_task: An object representing the asynchronous task that is being processed.
· goals: A list that accumulates the goals for the current processing task.
· uov_input_image: The input image that needs to be processed for upscaling.
· uov_method: A string indicating the method to be used for upscaling.
· performance: An object that contains performance-related settings and metrics.
· steps: An integer representing the number of processing steps to be executed.
· current_progress: An integer indicating the current progress of the task.
· advance_progress: A boolean flag that indicates whether to advance the progress counter.
· skip_prompt_processing: A boolean flag that determines if prompt processing should be skipped.

**Code Description**: The prepare_upscale function is responsible for preparing an input image for upscaling operations. It begins by converting the input image into a height-width-channel format using the HWC3 function, ensuring that the image is in the correct format for further processing. If the uov_method includes 'vary', it appends 'vary' to the goals list. If the uov_method includes 'upscale', it appends 'upscale' to the goals list. 

In cases where 'fast' is part of the uov_method, the function sets skip_prompt_processing to True and sets the steps to 0, indicating that no processing steps will be executed for this method. If 'fast' is not included, it retrieves the number of steps for the upscale operation by calling the steps_uov method from the performance object, which returns the appropriate number of steps based on the current performance settings.

The function also manages the progress of the task. If advance_progress is set to True, it increments the current_progress by 1. It then calls the progressbar function to update the user on the task's progress, specifically indicating that upscale models are being downloaded. The downloading_upscale_model function is invoked to handle the actual downloading of the necessary upscale model files.

The prepare_upscale function is called within the apply_image_input function, where it is used to prepare the input image for upscaling based on the current task's requirements. This highlights its role in the broader image processing workflow, ensuring that images are correctly formatted and that necessary resources are available before proceeding with the upscale operation.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the input image is valid and that the uov_method is correctly specified. The function relies on the performance object to provide the appropriate number of steps, and any issues with the downloading process may affect the overall functionality.

**Output Example**: A possible return value from the function could be a tuple containing the processed input image, a boolean indicating whether prompt processing should be skipped, and an integer representing the number of steps to be executed, such as (processed_image, False, 10).
***
### FunctionDef prepare_enhance_prompt(prompt, fallback_prompt)
**prepare_enhance_prompt**: The function of prepare_enhance_prompt is to ensure that a valid prompt is provided by checking the input prompt and substituting it with a fallback prompt if necessary.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· prompt: A string that represents the main prompt to be enhanced.
· fallback_prompt: A string that serves as a backup prompt in case the main prompt is deemed invalid.

**Code Description**: The prepare_enhance_prompt function takes two string parameters: prompt and fallback_prompt. It first sanitizes the main prompt using the safe_str function to ensure that it is a clean and valid string. If the sanitized prompt is empty or consists solely of empty lines, the function replaces the prompt with the fallback_prompt. This is achieved by checking if the safe_str of the prompt is an empty string or if the length of the list returned by remove_empty_str (which filters out empty strings from the prompt split into lines) is zero. If either condition is true, the prompt is set to the fallback_prompt. Finally, the function returns the validated prompt.

This function is called within the process_enhance function, where it is used to process both the main prompt and the negative prompt. By ensuring that valid prompts are provided, prepare_enhance_prompt plays a crucial role in maintaining the integrity of the input data before it is further processed in the enhancement workflow. This helps prevent potential errors or unexpected behavior during the execution of tasks that rely on these prompts.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the fallback_prompt is a meaningful alternative, as it will be used whenever the main prompt is found to be invalid. Developers should also be aware that if both the prompt and fallback_prompt are empty or invalid, the function will return an empty string, which may not be the desired outcome.

**Output Example**: If the input to prepare_enhance_prompt is `prompt = "  \n\n  "` and `fallback_prompt = "Default prompt"`, the output will be `"Default prompt"`. If the input is `prompt = "This is a valid prompt."` and `fallback_prompt = "Fallback prompt"`, the output will be `"This is a valid prompt."`.
***
### FunctionDef stop_processing(async_task, processing_start_time)
**stop_processing**: The function of stop_processing is to halt the processing of an asynchronous task and log the total processing time.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· async_task: An instance of AsyncTask that represents the task being processed. This object contains various attributes related to the task's state and configuration.
· processing_start_time: A float representing the time at which the processing started, measured in seconds since the epoch.

**Code Description**: The stop_processing function is designed to stop the processing of an asynchronous task by setting the processing attribute of the async_task to False. This indicates that the task is no longer being processed. The function then calculates the total processing time by subtracting the processing_start_time from the current time, which is obtained using time.perf_counter(). This total processing time is then printed to the console in a formatted string, providing a clear indication of how long the task was active.

This function is called within the handler function of the same module, which is responsible for managing the lifecycle of an asynchronous task. The handler function prepares the task, processes various parameters, and executes the main logic for the task. If certain conditions are met, such as when the task should not be enhanced, the stop_processing function is invoked to terminate the task and log the processing time. This relationship is crucial as it ensures that the task is properly concluded and that performance metrics are recorded, which can be useful for debugging and optimization purposes.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that stop_processing is called in scenarios where the task needs to be halted to avoid leaving tasks in an inconsistent state. Proper handling of the async_task state is essential for maintaining the integrity of the task management system.

**Code Description**: The process_enhance function orchestrates the enhancement of images by applying various transformations based on the specified goals and parameters. It begins by preparing the prompts for enhancement, ensuring that valid prompts are provided. The function then checks if the goals include varying, upscaling, or inpainting and applies the corresponding processing steps.

If the 'vary' goal is present, the function calls apply_vary to adjust the image and denoising strength accordingly. For the 'upscale' goal, it invokes apply_upscale to upscale the image and manage the associated processing steps. If 'inpaint' is specified and the inpainting engine is parameterized, it downloads the necessary inpainting models and applies inpainting using apply_inpaint.

The function also manages the progress of the task by updating the current progress and yielding results back to the async_task. It utilizes helper functions such as progressbar to provide feedback on the ongoing operations and yield_result to store the processed images.

The process_enhance function is called by other functions within the project, notably enhance_upscale and handler, which manage the overall workflow of image processing tasks. This highlights its role in the image generation pipeline, allowing for flexible configurations and refinements based on user-defined parameters.

**Note**: It is essential to ensure that all input parameters are correctly structured and that the models and conditions are compatible to avoid runtime errors during the processing. The use of the callback function and preview options should be configured based on user preferences.

**Code Description**: The enhance_upscale function is designed to enhance images by performing upscaling and inpainting operations based on the parameters provided. It begins by resetting the inpaint worker to avoid tensor size issues. The function calculates the current progress based on the base progress and the number of steps completed. It prepares the input image for upscaling by calling the prepare_upscale function, which processes the image according to specified methods and performance parameters.

The function then applies any necessary overrides to the processing steps using the apply_overrides function, ensuring that the parameters are adjusted based on the async_task attributes. If there are enhancement goals specified, the function attempts to process these enhancements by calling the process_enhance function, which manages the actual enhancement operations, including varying, upscaling, and inpainting.

The enhance_upscale function is called within the handler function, which orchestrates the overall image processing workflow. The handler prepares the necessary parameters and invokes enhance_upscale for each image that needs enhancement. This establishes a clear relationship where enhance_upscale is responsible for the detailed enhancement logic while being part of a larger task management system.

The function also handles exceptions related to user interruptions through the InterruptProcessingException, allowing for graceful handling of user commands to skip or stop processing. The results of the enhancement process, including the updated image and progress metrics, are returned to the caller for further handling.

**Note**: It is essential to ensure that all input parameters are correctly structured and that the models and conditions are compatible to avoid runtime errors during the processing. Proper handling of the InterruptProcessingException is crucial to maintain the integrity of the processing flow.

**Output Example**: A possible return value from the enhance_upscale function could be:
```python
(current_task_id, done_steps_inpainting, done_steps_upscaling, processed_image, exception_result)
```
Where `current_task_id` is an integer indicating the ID of the current task, `done_steps_inpainting` and `done_steps_upscaling` are integers representing the completed steps for inpainting and upscaling respectively, `processed_image` is a NumPy array representing the enhanced image, and `exception_result` is a string indicating the result of the processing (e.g., 'continue' or 'break').
***
### FunctionDef handler(async_task)
**handler**: The function of handler is to manage the processing of an asynchronous task related to image generation and enhancement.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· async_task: An instance of AsyncTask that contains various attributes and settings for the processing task.

**Code Description**: The handler function is responsible for orchestrating the preparation and execution of an asynchronous image processing task. It begins by recording the start time for performance measurement and setting the processing state of the async_task to True. The function then normalizes various input parameters, such as converting selections to lowercase and handling specific flags related to the task's configuration.

The handler checks if a specific expansion style is selected and adjusts the style selections accordingly. It also verifies if the base model and refiner model are the same, disabling the refiner if they are identical. The function then initializes the progress tracking and sets default configurations based on the performance selection of the async_task, which can include extreme speed, lightning, or hyper SD modes. Each performance mode has its own set of default parameters that are applied to the async_task.

The handler function prints out the current configuration parameters for debugging purposes and applies any necessary patch settings to the async_task. It prepares the input image and mask for processing, loading any required models and configurations based on the current task's goals. The function also manages the loading of control models and applies any necessary overrides to the processing steps.

Throughout the execution, the handler function utilizes several helper functions, such as apply_image_input, apply_patch_settings, and apply_control_nets, to modularize the processing workflow. It also handles user interruptions gracefully by catching the InterruptProcessingException, allowing the user to skip or stop the processing as needed.

The relationship with its callees is significant, as the handler serves as the entry point for processing tasks, coordinating various functions that handle specific aspects of the image generation and enhancement workflow. This modular approach ensures that each component can be maintained and updated independently while contributing to the overall functionality of the asynchronous processing system.

**Note**: It is essential to ensure that the async_task is properly initialized with valid parameters before invoking the handler function. Additionally, any changes to the task's state or parameters should be made with caution to maintain the integrity of the processing workflow.

**Output Example**: A possible appearance of the code's return value could be an updated state of the async_task, reflecting the progress and results of the processing, such as:
```
async_task.results = ['/path/to/generated_image1.png', '/path/to/generated_image2.png']
async_task.processing = False
```
#### FunctionDef callback(step, x0, x, total_steps, y)
**callback**: The function of callback is to update the progress of an asynchronous task during its execution.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· parameter1: step - An integer representing the current step of the asynchronous task.
· parameter2: x0 - A variable that may represent the initial state or input for the task (its specific use is not detailed in the provided code).
· parameter3: x - A variable that may represent the current state or output of the task (its specific use is not detailed in the provided code).
· parameter4: total_steps - An integer indicating the total number of steps in the asynchronous task.
· parameter5: y - A variable that may represent additional data or context relevant to the task (its specific use is not detailed in the provided code).

**Code Description**: The callback function is designed to manage and report the progress of an asynchronous task. When the function is invoked, it first checks if the current step is zero. If it is, it initializes the `callback_steps` attribute of the `async_task` object to zero. This attribute is used to track the cumulative progress of the task. The function then updates `callback_steps` by adding the ratio of the remaining preparation steps to the total number of steps, effectively calculating the percentage of progress made. 

Subsequently, the function appends a new entry to the `yields` list of the `async_task` object. This entry consists of a label ('preview') and a tuple containing two elements: the current progress (calculated by adding `current_progress` to `callback_steps`) and a formatted string that provides a status update on the sampling step and the current task ID. The variable `y` is included in the tuple, potentially representing additional context or data related to the task.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the `async_task` object is properly initialized and that its attributes (`callback_steps`, `yields`, and `current_progress`) are defined before invoking this function. Additionally, the variables `preparation_steps`, `all_steps`, `current_task_id`, and `total_count` should be correctly set in the surrounding context to avoid runtime errors.
