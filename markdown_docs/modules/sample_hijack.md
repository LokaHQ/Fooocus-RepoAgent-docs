## FunctionDef clip_separate_inner(c, p, target_model, target_clip)
**clip_separate_inner**: The function of clip_separate_inner is to process and modify the input tensor based on the specified model type and return the modified tensor along with an optional pooled output.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· c: A tensor representing the input conditions that will be processed.  
· p: An optional tensor representing the pooled output, which may be modified during processing.  
· target_model: An optional parameter that specifies the model type to determine how the input tensor is processed. It can be an instance of SDXLRefiner, SDXL, or None.  
· target_clip: An optional parameter that provides additional context for processing, specifically when the target_model is not one of the specified types.

**Code Description**: The clip_separate_inner function is designed to handle the processing of the input tensor `c` based on the type of model specified by `target_model`. 

1. If `target_model` is None or an instance of SDXLRefiner, the function modifies `c` by retaining only the last 1280 elements along the last dimension and creates a clone of this modified tensor.
2. If `target_model` is an instance of SDXL, the function simply clones `c` without any modifications.
3. For any other type of `target_model`, the function sets `p` to None and modifies `c` to retain only the first 768 elements along the last dimension. It then performs additional processing using the `target_clip` parameter, specifically accessing the `final_layer_norm` from the `target_clip.cond_stage_model.clip_l.transformer.text_model`.

The function temporarily moves the `final_layer_norm` and `c` tensors to the CPU with a float32 data type to ensure compatibility during processing. It then chunks the tensor `c` into smaller segments, applies the `final_layer_norm` to each chunk, and concatenates the results back into a single tensor. Finally, the function restores the original device and data type for both `final_layer_norm` and `c`.

The clip_separate_inner function is called by two other functions within the project: `clip_separate` and `clip_separate_after_preparation`. In `clip_separate`, it processes a list of conditions, modifying each input tensor and optionally updating the pooled output. Similarly, in `clip_separate_after_preparation`, it processes a collection of conditions, ensuring that the output is structured correctly for further use. Both caller functions rely on clip_separate_inner to handle the intricacies of tensor modification based on the model type.

**Note**: When utilizing the clip_separate_inner function, it is crucial to ensure that the `target_model` is correctly specified to avoid unintended tensor modifications. Additionally, the function assumes that the `target_clip` parameter is provided when necessary, particularly when dealing with models other than SDXLRefiner or SDXL.

**Output Example**: A possible appearance of the code's return value could be a modified tensor `c` that has been processed according to the specified model type, along with an optional pooled output `p`, structured as a tuple (c, p). For instance, the output might look like (tensor([[...]]), {'pooled_output': tensor([[...]])}) if `p` is not None.
## FunctionDef clip_separate(cond, target_model, target_clip)
**clip_separate**: The function of clip_separate is to process a list of conditions by modifying each input tensor and optionally updating the pooled output based on specified model types.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· cond: A list of tuples where each tuple contains a condition and a dictionary with a potential pooled output.  
· target_model: An optional parameter that specifies the model type to determine how the input tensor is processed. It can be an instance of SDXLRefiner, SDXL, or None.  
· target_clip: An optional parameter that provides additional context for processing, specifically when the target_model is not one of the specified types.

**Code Description**: The clip_separate function iterates over a list of conditions provided in the `cond` parameter. For each condition, it extracts the pooled output from the associated dictionary. It then calls the clip_separate_inner function, passing the condition and pooled output along with the optional parameters `target_model` and `target_clip`. The clip_separate_inner function is responsible for modifying the input tensor based on the specified model type and returning the modified tensor along with an optional pooled output.

The results of the processing are collected in a list, where each entry consists of the modified condition and its corresponding pooled output. Finally, the function returns this list of results.

The clip_separate function is called within the process_diffusion function located in the modules/default_pipeline.py file. In process_diffusion, clip_separate is utilized to process both positive and negative conditions before they are passed to the ksampler function. This ensures that the conditions are appropriately modified based on the model type being used, which is crucial for the subsequent steps in the diffusion process.

**Note**: When using the clip_separate function, it is important to ensure that the `target_model` is correctly specified to avoid unintended tensor modifications. Additionally, the function assumes that the `target_clip` parameter is provided when necessary, particularly when dealing with models other than SDXLRefiner or SDXL.

**Output Example**: A possible appearance of the code's return value could be a list of modified conditions and their corresponding pooled outputs, structured as follows: 
```python
[
    [modified_condition_1, {'pooled_output': tensor([[...]])}],
    [modified_condition_2, {'pooled_output': tensor([[...]])}],
    ...
]
```
## FunctionDef clip_separate_after_preparation(cond, target_model, target_clip)
**clip_separate_after_preparation**: The function of clip_separate_after_preparation is to process a list of conditioning data, modifying each entry based on specified model parameters and returning a structured list of results.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· cond: A list of dictionaries containing conditioning data, where each dictionary may include a 'pooled_output' tensor and a 'model_conds' key with further conditioning information.  
· target_model: An optional parameter that specifies the model type to determine how the input tensors are processed. It can be an instance of specific model classes or None.  
· target_clip: An optional parameter that provides additional context for processing, particularly when the target_model is not one of the specified types.

**Code Description**: The clip_separate_after_preparation function iterates over each entry in the provided list of conditioning data (`cond`). For each entry, it extracts the 'pooled_output' tensor and the conditioning tensor (`c`) from the 'model_conds' key. The function then calls clip_separate_inner, passing the conditioning tensor and pooled output along with the specified target model and target clip. This inner function processes the tensors according to the model type, potentially modifying the conditioning tensor and the pooled output.

The results of the processing are collected in a list. Each processed entry is structured as a dictionary containing the modified conditioning tensor wrapped in a CONDRegular instance, and if the pooled output is not None, it is cloned and included in the result. Finally, the function returns the list of processed results.

This function is called within the sample_hacked function, which is responsible for generating samples from a model. In this context, clip_separate_after_preparation is utilized to refine the conditioning data for both positive and negative inputs before they are encoded and passed to the model for sampling. This ensures that the conditioning data is appropriately prepared based on the current model's requirements, facilitating effective sample generation.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the conditioning data provided in `cond` is structured correctly, as the function expects specific keys to be present in each dictionary. Additionally, the target_model should be specified accurately to avoid unintended modifications during processing.

**Output Example**: A possible appearance of the code's return value could be a list of dictionaries, each containing a 'model_conds' key with a CONDRegular instance and an optional 'pooled_output' tensor, structured as follows:
```python
[
    {'model_conds': {'c_crossattn': CONDRegular(tensor([[...]]))}, 'pooled_output': tensor([[...]])},
    {'model_conds': {'c_crossattn': CONDRegular(tensor([[...]]))}},
    ...
]
```
## FunctionDef sample_hacked(model, noise, positive, negative, cfg, device, sampler, sigmas, model_options, latent_image, denoise_mask, callback, disable_pbar, seed)
**sample_hacked**: The function of sample_hacked is to generate samples from a model using specified conditions, noise, and various parameters while incorporating a refiner mechanism for enhanced output quality.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· model: An object representing the model used for generating samples.
· noise: A tensor containing noise data to be used in the sampling process.
· positive: A list of dictionaries representing positive conditions for the model.
· negative: A list of dictionaries representing negative conditions for the model.
· cfg: A configuration parameter that influences the sampling process.
· device: A string or device object indicating the computational device (e.g., CPU or GPU).
· sampler: An object responsible for the sampling process.
· sigmas: A tensor containing sigma values used in the sampling.
· model_options: A dictionary of additional options for the model (default is an empty dictionary).
· latent_image: An optional tensor representing a latent image to be processed (default is None).
· denoise_mask: An optional tensor used for denoising (default is None).
· callback: An optional function that can be called during the sampling process (default is None).
· disable_pbar: A boolean flag to disable the progress bar during sampling (default is False).
· seed: An optional integer seed for random number generation (default is None).

**Code Description**: The sample_hacked function begins by making copies of the positive and negative condition lists to avoid modifying the original data. It then calls the resolve_areas_and_cond_masks function to ensure that the areas and masks for both positive and negative conditions are correctly defined based on the noise tensor's dimensions. The model is wrapped using the wrap_model function, which prepares it for noise prediction tasks.

Next, the function calculates the start and end timesteps for both positive and negative conditions using the calculate_start_end_timesteps function. If a latent image is provided, it is processed through the model. The function checks for any extra conditions defined in the model and encodes the model conditions for both positive and negative lists using the encode_model_conds function.

To ensure that each condition has a corresponding opposite condition with the same area, the function iterates through the positive and negative conditions, calling create_cond_with_same_area_if_none as needed. The pre_run_control function is then invoked to prepare the model for sampling based on the positive conditions.

The function applies empty values to equal areas between positive and negative conditions using apply_empty_x_to_equal_area. It prepares a dictionary of extra arguments that will be passed to the sampler. If a current refiner is defined, it processes the positive and negative conditions through the refiner, ensuring that they are appropriately encoded.

A nested function, refiner_switch, is defined to handle the swapping of the current refiner model when certain conditions are met during the sampling process. Another nested function, callback_wrap, is defined to manage callback functionality during sampling.

Finally, the function calls the sampler's sample method, passing in the wrapped model, noise, and other parameters, and processes the output through the model to return the final samples.

The sample_hacked function is called by the ksampler function, which serves as a higher-level interface for generating samples. The ksampler function prepares the necessary inputs and invokes sample_hacked, allowing for a structured sampling process that can include refiners and various configurations.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the conditions provided to the sample_hacked function are correctly formatted and that any optional parameters are specified as needed. The function modifies the input conditions in place, which may affect subsequent operations on these lists.

**Output Example**: A possible appearance of the code's return value could be a tensor representing the generated samples, structured as follows:
```python
tensor([[...], [...], ...])
```
### FunctionDef refiner_switch
**refiner_switch**: The function of refiner_switch is to manage the transition between different model refiners by cleaning up additional models and loading the appropriate ones based on specified conditions.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· parameter1: None

**Code Description**: The refiner_switch function is responsible for orchestrating the model management process when switching between different refiners in a machine learning context. It begins by invoking the cleanup_additional_models function, which takes a set of models derived from both positive and negative conditioning inputs. This ensures that any previously loaded models that are no longer needed are properly cleaned up, thereby preventing memory leaks and optimizing resource usage.

Next, the function sets up the extra_args dictionary with two keys: "cond" and "uncond". The "cond" key is assigned the value of positive_refiner, while the "uncond" key is assigned the value of negative_refiner. This step prepares the necessary arguments for the subsequent model loading process.

The function then clears the ip-adapter for the refiner by resetting the model options in the extra_args dictionary. It iterates through the existing model options and ensures that any transformer options are reset to an empty dictionary, while other options remain unchanged.

Following this, the refiner_switch function calls get_additional_models, passing in the positive_refiner, negative_refiner, and the current_refiner's model data type. This function retrieves the relevant additional models and calculates the inference memory required for loading these models onto the GPU.

The load_models_gpu function is then called with the current_refiner and the additional models obtained from get_additional_models. This function manages the loading of these models onto the GPU, ensuring that sufficient memory is available and that the models are prepared for inference.

Finally, the inner_model attribute of model_wrap is updated to reference the current_refiner's model, and a message indicating that the refiner has been swapped is printed to the console. The function does not return any value.

The refiner_switch function is called within the callback_wrap function, specifically when a certain step (refiner_switch_step) is reached and the current_refiner is not None. This indicates that the refiner_switch function is part of a larger process that involves iterative steps, likely in a sampling or inference scenario, where model switching is necessary based on the progression of the process.

**Note**: It is essential to ensure that the positive_refiner and negative_refiner variables are correctly defined and that the models being managed are compatible with the GPU environment to avoid runtime errors.

**Output Example**: The refiner_switch function does not produce a return value; however, it will print "Refiner Swapped" to the console upon successful execution.
***
### FunctionDef callback_wrap(step, x0, x, total_steps)
**callback_wrap**: The function of callback_wrap is to manage the execution of a callback function during a specific step in a process, potentially triggering a refiner switch.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· parameter1: step - An integer representing the current step in the process.
· parameter2: x0 - The initial state or input data before any modifications.
· parameter3: x - The current state or modified data at the current step.
· parameter4: total_steps - An integer indicating the total number of steps in the process.

**Code Description**: The callback_wrap function is designed to facilitate the execution of a callback function while also managing the transition between different model refiners based on the current step in a process. It takes four parameters: step, x0, x, and total_steps, which provide context for the callback execution.

At the beginning of the function, there is a conditional check to determine if the current step matches a predefined value, referred to as refiner_switch_step, and whether the current_refiner is not None. If both conditions are met, the function refiner_switch is invoked. This indicates that the callback_wrap function is part of a larger iterative process where model refiners may need to be switched based on the progression of steps. The refiner_switch function is responsible for managing the transition between different model refiners, ensuring that the appropriate models are loaded and that unnecessary models are cleaned up.

Following the potential invocation of refiner_switch, the function checks if a callback function has been defined (i.e., if callback is not None). If a callback function is available, it is executed with the parameters step, x0, x, and total_steps. This allows the callback to utilize the current state of the process and the initial state for any necessary computations or actions.

The callback_wrap function does not return any value; its primary role is to manage the execution flow and ensure that the appropriate actions are taken at specific steps in the process, particularly in relation to model management and callback execution.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the callback function is properly defined and that the parameters passed to it are appropriate for its expected behavior. Additionally, the refiner_switch_step and current_refiner variables must be correctly set up to avoid unintended behavior during the execution of the callback_wrap function.
***
## FunctionDef calculate_sigmas_scheduler_hacked(model, scheduler_name, steps)
**calculate_sigmas_scheduler_hacked**: The function of calculate_sigmas_scheduler_hacked is to generate a sequence of sigma values based on the specified scheduler name and the model's sampling parameters.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· model: An object representing the model from which sigma values are derived. It contains properties related to sigma_min and sigma_max used in the scheduling process.
· scheduler_name: A string that specifies the name of the scheduling method to be used for generating sigma values. It determines which algorithm will be applied to calculate the noise schedule.
· steps: An integer indicating the number of sigma values to generate in the schedule.

**Code Description**: The calculate_sigmas_scheduler_hacked function is designed to produce a tensor of sigma values tailored to various scheduling strategies based on the provided scheduler_name. The function begins by evaluating the scheduler_name parameter to determine which noise scheduling method to invoke. 

If the scheduler_name is "karras", it calls the get_sigmas_karras function from the k_diffusion_sampling module, which generates a noise schedule based on the Karras et al. (2022) methodology. This method requires the number of steps, as well as the minimum and maximum sigma values derived from the model's sampling properties.

For the "exponential" scheduler_name, the function utilizes get_sigmas_exponential, which constructs an exponential noise schedule. Similar to the Karras method, it also requires the number of steps and the sigma_min and sigma_max values.

When the scheduler_name is "normal", the function calls normal_scheduler, which generates sigma values based on a linear interpolation between the model's defined sigma_max and sigma_min. The same applies for "simple", which invokes simple_scheduler to create evenly spaced sigma values.

For the "ddim_uniform" scheduler_name, the function uses ddim_scheduler to generate sigma values specifically for the Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM). If the scheduler_name is "sgm_uniform", it calls normal_scheduler with the sgm flag set to True, indicating a specific sampling strategy.

The "turbo" scheduler_name triggers the SDTurboScheduler's get_sigmas method, which computes sigma values based on the model's sampling method and the specified number of steps. Lastly, if the scheduler_name is "align_your_steps", the function determines the model type (either 'SDXL' or 'SD1') based on the model's latent format and calls the AlignYourStepsScheduler's get_sigmas method to obtain the required sigma values.

If an invalid scheduler_name is provided, the function raises a TypeError, ensuring that only recognized scheduling methods are utilized. The output of the function is a tensor containing the computed sigma values, which are essential for various sampling processes in the model.

**Note**: It is crucial to ensure that the model passed to this function has the necessary sampling attributes defined, particularly sigma_min and sigma_max, to avoid runtime errors. Additionally, the scheduler_name must correspond to one of the recognized scheduling methods to ensure proper execution.

**Output Example**: A possible return value of the function could be a tensor such as:
```
tensor([0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.0])
```
This output represents a sequence of sigma values generated for the specified steps, with the last value indicating no noise at the final step.
