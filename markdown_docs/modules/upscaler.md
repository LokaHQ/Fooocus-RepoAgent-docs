## FunctionDef perform_upscale(img)
**perform_upscale**: The function of perform_upscale is to upscale an input image using a pre-trained model, ensuring efficient memory management during the process.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
Â· img: A NumPy array representing the input image that is to be upscaled.

**Code Description**: The perform_upscale function begins by declaring a global variable `model`, which is intended to hold the pre-trained upscale model. The function first prints the shape of the input image to provide feedback on the image being processed.

It then checks if the `model` is None, indicating that the model has not been loaded yet. If the model is not loaded, it calls the downloading_upscale_model function to download the model file. After downloading, it loads the model weights using PyTorch's `torch.load` method. The weights are processed to replace certain keys in the state dictionary, ensuring compatibility with the model architecture. The model is then moved to CPU and set to evaluation mode.

Next, the input image is converted from a NumPy array to a PyTorch tensor using the core.numpy_to_pytorch function. The upscaling process is performed by calling the upscale function from the opImageUpscaleWithModel class, which applies the upscale model to the input tensor. The output tensor is then converted back to a NumPy array using the core.pytorch_to_numpy function.

The perform_upscale function is called within the apply_upscale function in the modules/async_worker.py file. In this context, apply_upscale prepares the input image and manages the upscaling process, including handling different upscaling methods and ensuring that the image is processed correctly based on its dimensions.

**Note**: It is crucial to ensure that the upscale model is properly initialized and loaded before calling the perform_upscale function. Additionally, the input image must be formatted correctly as a NumPy array to avoid errors during processing.

**Output Example**: A possible return value of the function could be a NumPy array representing the upscaled image, with dimensions reflecting the increased size based on the upscale model's scaling factor. For instance, if the input image has a shape of (224, 224, 3), the output might have a shape of (448, 448, 3) if the upscale factor is 2.
