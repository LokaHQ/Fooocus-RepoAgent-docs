## FunctionDef webpath(fn)
**webpath**: The function of webpath is to generate a web-accessible file path for a given filename.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
路 fn: The filename or path of the file for which the web-accessible path is to be generated.

**Code Description**: The webpath function takes a single parameter, fn, which represents the filename or path of a file. The function first checks if the provided filename starts with a predefined variable, script_path. If it does, it calculates the relative path from script_path to fn using the os.path.relpath method, ensuring that any backslashes in the path are replaced with forward slashes for compatibility with web URLs. If fn does not start with script_path, the function retrieves the absolute path of fn using os.path.abspath.

The function then constructs a web-accessible string that includes the file path and its last modification time, formatted as 'file={web_path}?{os.path.getmtime(fn)}'. This output is particularly useful for web applications that need to reference static files, ensuring that the most recent version of the file is served by including the modification timestamp as a query parameter.

The webpath function is called by other functions in the project, specifically javascript_html and css_html. In javascript_html, multiple JavaScript files are processed through webpath to generate their respective web-accessible paths, which are then included in the HTML head section as script tags. Similarly, in css_html, the function is used to generate the path for a CSS file, which is included as a link tag in the HTML head. This demonstrates the utility of webpath in dynamically generating paths for resources that are essential for the functioning of web applications.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the script_path variable is correctly defined in the context where webpath is used, as it directly affects the output of the function. Additionally, the function assumes that the provided filename exists and is accessible.

**Output Example**: An example of the return value from the webpath function could be: 'file=javascript/script.js?1625097600', where 'javascript/script.js' is the web-accessible path and '1625097600' is the last modification timestamp of the file.
## FunctionDef javascript_html
**javascript_html**: The function of javascript_html is to generate an HTML head section containing script tags for various JavaScript files and a meta tag for the samples path.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
路 None

**Code Description**: The javascript_html function constructs a string that represents the HTML head section for a web page. It begins by defining paths to several JavaScript files using the webpath function, which generates web-accessible paths for each file. The JavaScript files included are script.js, contextMenus.js, localization.js, zoom.js, edit-attention.js, viewer.js, and imageviewer.js. Additionally, it defines a path for a sample image located in the sdxl_styles/samples directory.

The function also incorporates localization data by calling the localization_js function with the current language specified in args_manager.args.language. This function returns a JavaScript snippet that assigns the localization data to a global variable, which is then embedded in the head section.

If a theme is specified in args_manager.args.theme, the function adds a script tag to set the theme using the set_theme function. The final output is a string containing all the constructed script tags and meta tags, which can be directly inserted into the HTML document.

The javascript_html function is called by the reload_javascript function, which is responsible for injecting the generated JavaScript and CSS into the response body of a web application. This integration ensures that the necessary JavaScript resources are loaded when the web page is rendered, facilitating the functionality of the application.

**Note**: It is essential to ensure that all referenced JavaScript files exist and are accessible at the specified paths. Additionally, the localization JSON file must be correctly formatted to avoid runtime errors.

**Output Example**: A possible appearance of the code's return value could be:
```html
<script type="text/javascript">window.localization = {"greeting": "Hello", "farewell": "Goodbye"};</script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="file=javascript/script.js?1625097600"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="file=javascript/contextMenus.js?1625097600"></script>
<meta name="samples-path" content="file=/absolute/path/to/sdxl_styles/samples/fooocus_v2.jpg?1625097600">
```
## FunctionDef css_html
**css_html**: The function of css_html is to generate an HTML link tag that references a CSS stylesheet.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
路 None

**Code Description**: The css_html function is designed to create a link element for a CSS stylesheet that can be included in the head section of an HTML document. It begins by calling the webpath function with the argument 'css/style.css', which generates a web-accessible path for the specified CSS file. The webpath function constructs this path based on the current script's location and the last modification time of the file, ensuring that the most recent version is served to the client.

The output of the webpath function is then used to create a formatted string that represents an HTML link tag. This tag includes the generated path as the href attribute, allowing the browser to load the stylesheet when rendering the page. The final output of the css_html function is a string containing the complete link tag, which can be directly inserted into the HTML document.

The css_html function is called by the reload_javascript function, which is responsible for dynamically injecting both JavaScript and CSS resources into the HTML response. Within reload_javascript, the output of css_html is included in the body of the response, ensuring that the CSS styles are applied to the rendered page. This demonstrates the function's role in facilitating the integration of stylesheets into web applications, enhancing the overall user interface.

**Note**: It is essential to ensure that the CSS file specified in the css_html function exists and is accessible at the time of execution. Additionally, the correct configuration of the script_path variable in the context of the webpath function is crucial for generating the accurate web-accessible path.

**Output Example**: A possible return value from the css_html function could be: '<link rel="stylesheet" property="stylesheet" href="file=css/style.css?1625097600">', where 'css/style.css' is the web-accessible path and '1625097600' is the last modification timestamp of the file.
## FunctionDef reload_javascript
**reload_javascript**: The function of reload_javascript is to dynamically inject JavaScript and CSS resources into the HTML response of a web application.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
路 None

**Code Description**: The reload_javascript function is designed to enhance the HTML response of a web application by injecting necessary JavaScript and CSS resources. It achieves this by first calling the javascript_html and css_html functions, which generate the appropriate HTML snippets for JavaScript and CSS, respectively.

The function begins by invoking javascript_html(), which constructs a string containing multiple script tags for various JavaScript files and a meta tag for the samples path. This includes paths for essential scripts such as script.js, contextMenus.js, and localization.js, among others. Additionally, it incorporates localization data based on the current language settings. The generated HTML string is stored in the variable js.

Next, the function calls css_html(), which generates a link tag referencing a CSS stylesheet. This ensures that the styles defined in the CSS file are applied to the web page. The output of this function is stored in the variable css.

The core functionality of reload_javascript is encapsulated in the nested function template_response, which overrides the default TemplateResponse behavior of the Gradio framework. This nested function takes variable arguments (*args, **kwargs) and creates a response object using GradioTemplateResponseOriginal. It then modifies the response body by replacing the closing </head> and </body> tags with the injected JavaScript and CSS snippets, respectively. This ensures that the necessary resources are included in the rendered HTML.

Finally, the reload_javascript function assigns the modified template_response function to gr.routes.templates.TemplateResponse, effectively replacing the original response handling with the customized version that includes the injected resources.

This function is called within the webui.py module, which is likely responsible for handling web requests and rendering the user interface of the application. By integrating reload_javascript into the webui.py workflow, the application ensures that all necessary JavaScript and CSS resources are loaded correctly, enhancing the functionality and appearance of the web application.

**Note**: It is crucial to ensure that all referenced JavaScript and CSS files exist and are accessible at the specified paths. Additionally, proper configuration of the localization data and theme settings is necessary to avoid runtime errors and ensure the correct rendering of the web application.

**Output Example**: A possible appearance of the code's return value could be:
```html
<script type="text/javascript">window.localization = {"greeting": "Hello", "farewell": "Goodbye"};</script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="file=javascript/script.js?1625097600"></script>
<link rel="stylesheet" property="stylesheet" href="file=css/style.css?1625097600">
```
### FunctionDef template_response
**template_response**: The function of template_response is to create a customized HTTP response by modifying the body of the original Gradio template response to include additional JavaScript and CSS.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
路 *args: A variable-length argument list that is passed to the original Gradio template response constructor.
路 **kwargs: A variable-length keyword argument dictionary that is passed to the original Gradio template response constructor.

**Code Description**: The template_response function begins by invoking the GradioTemplateResponseOriginal constructor with the provided *args and **kwargs. This creates an instance of the original response object. The function then modifies the body of this response. Specifically, it replaces the closing `</head>` tag in the response body with a new string that includes additional JavaScript (denoted by the variable `js`), followed by the original closing `</head>` tag. Similarly, it replaces the closing `</body>` tag with a new string that includes additional CSS (denoted by the variable `css`), followed by the original closing `</body>` tag. After these modifications, the function calls the `init_headers` method on the response object to initialize the HTTP headers appropriately. Finally, the modified response object is returned.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the variables `js` and `css` are defined and contain valid JavaScript and CSS content, respectively, before calling this function. Additionally, the function assumes that the original response body contains the standard HTML structure with `</head>` and `</body>` tags.

**Output Example**: A possible appearance of the code's return value could be an HTTP response object with a body that looks like the following:

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Example Title</title>
    <script src="path/to/your/javascript.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to the Example Page</h1>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="path/to/your/styles.css">
</body>
</html>
``` 

In this example, the JavaScript and CSS have been successfully injected into the response body.
