## FunctionDef normalize_key(k)
**normalize_key**: The function of normalize_key is to format a given string by replacing certain characters and adjusting the capitalization of words.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· k: A string that needs to be normalized.

**Code Description**: The normalize_key function takes a single string parameter, k, and processes it to ensure consistent formatting. The function begins by replacing all occurrences of the hyphen ('-') with a space (' '). It then splits the modified string into individual words. Each word is transformed such that the first letter is capitalized and the remaining letters are in lowercase. After rejoining the words into a single string, the function performs additional replacements to ensure specific terms are formatted correctly: '3d' is changed to '3D', 'Sai' is changed to 'SAI', 'Mre' is changed to 'MRE', and '(s' is changed to '(S'. Finally, the function returns the fully normalized string.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the input string is in a format that can be processed by this function. The function is case-sensitive and will only capitalize the first letter of each word while converting the rest to lowercase. Additionally, specific terms are hardcoded for replacement, which means that any variations not explicitly mentioned will not be altered.

**Output Example**: If the input string is "hello-world this is a test 3d Sai Mre (s", the function would return "Hello World This Is A Test 3D SAI MRE (S".
## FunctionDef get_random_style(rng)
**get_random_style**: The function of get_random_style is to return a random style name from a predefined collection of styles.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· rng: An instance of the Random class used to generate random choices.

**Code Description**: The get_random_style function retrieves a random style name from a dictionary called styles, which is assumed to be defined elsewhere in the code. The function takes a single parameter, rng, which is an instance of the Random class from the random module. This instance is used to ensure that the selection of the style is random. The function converts the items of the styles dictionary into a list and uses the choice method of the rng object to select one of these items randomly. The function then returns the first element of the selected item, which corresponds to the style name.

This function is called within the process_prompt function in the async_worker module. Specifically, it is used when processing style selections for image generation tasks. If a style selection matches a placeholder (random_style_name), the get_random_style function is invoked to replace the placeholder with an actual random style name. This integration allows for dynamic and varied style application in the image generation process, enhancing the creative output of the system.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the styles dictionary is properly populated before calling this function, as the function relies on it to return a valid style name.

**Output Example**: An example output of the function could be "Vintage", assuming "Vintage" is one of the keys in the styles dictionary.
## FunctionDef apply_style(style, positive)
**apply_style**: The function of apply_style is to apply a specific style to a given positive prompt and return the modified prompts along with style-related information.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· style: A string representing the name of the style to be applied.
· positive: A string containing the positive prompt to which the style will be applied.

**Code Description**: The apply_style function retrieves the style information associated with the provided style name from a predefined dictionary called styles. It extracts the positive and negative components of the style. The function then replaces any placeholder '{prompt}' in the positive component with the actual positive prompt provided as an argument. The modified positive prompt is split into individual lines and returned as a list. Additionally, the function returns the negative component split into lines and a boolean indicating whether the placeholder was present in the original positive component. 

This function is called within the process_prompt function in the async_worker module, where it is used to enhance the positive prompts based on selected styles. The process_prompt function handles the preparation of prompts for image generation tasks, and it utilizes apply_style to incorporate styles into the prompts, allowing for more dynamic and varied outputs. The results from apply_style are then integrated into the overall task structure that is processed for generating images.

**Note**: When using apply_style, ensure that the style provided exists in the styles dictionary to avoid potential key errors. The function assumes that the style name is valid and that the corresponding style data is correctly formatted.

**Output Example**: If the styles dictionary contains an entry for 'artistic' with a positive prompt of "Create an artistic representation of {prompt}" and the positive input is "a sunset", the function would return:
- Modified positive prompts: ["Create an artistic representation of a sunset"]
- Negative prompts: [""] (assuming no negative prompt is defined for the 'artistic' style)
- Placeholder presence: True (indicating that the placeholder was replaced).
## FunctionDef get_words(arrays, total_mult, index)
**get_words**: The function of get_words is to recursively retrieve specific words from a list of comma-separated strings based on a given index.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· parameter1: arrays - A list of strings, where each string contains words separated by commas.
· parameter2: total_mult - An integer representing the total number of combinations of words derived from the arrays.
· parameter3: index - An integer indicating the position of the word to retrieve from the combinations.

**Code Description**: The get_words function operates by processing a list of comma-separated strings (arrays). If there is only one array, it directly returns the word at the specified index. For multiple arrays, it splits the first array into individual words and calculates the appropriate word to return based on the provided index. The index is adjusted to ensure it cycles through the words correctly, and the function is called recursively to handle the remaining arrays. This recursive approach allows the function to build a list of words that correspond to the specified index across all arrays.

The relationship with its caller, apply_arrays, is crucial. The apply_arrays function first extracts arrays from a given text using a regular expression. It calculates the total number of combinations of words that can be formed from these arrays and adjusts the index to ensure it falls within the valid range. It then calls get_words to retrieve the appropriate words based on the calculated index. The words returned by get_words are then used to replace the placeholders in the original text, effectively customizing the text based on the specified arrays.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the index provided to get_words is within the bounds of the total combinations of words. If the index exceeds the total combinations, it will be wrapped around using the modulo operation in the apply_arrays function.

**Output Example**: For an input where arrays = ["apple,banana,cherry", "dog,elephant,fox"], total_mult = 9, and index = 4, the output of get_words would be ["banana", "elephant"].
## FunctionDef apply_arrays(text, index)
**apply_arrays**: The function of apply_arrays is to process a given text by replacing placeholders with specific words derived from arrays defined within the text.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· parameter1: text - A string that may contain placeholders in the form of arrays, denoted by the syntax [[array]].
· parameter2: index - An integer that determines which combination of words to select from the identified arrays.

**Code Description**: The apply_arrays function begins by using a regular expression to find all occurrences of arrays within the provided text. These arrays are expected to be formatted as comma-separated values enclosed in double square brackets (e.g., [[apple,banana,cherry]]). If no arrays are found, the function returns the original text unchanged.

If arrays are present, the function prints a message indicating the text being processed. It then calculates the total number of combinations that can be formed from the words in the arrays. This is done by splitting each array into individual words and multiplying the lengths of these arrays together. The index is adjusted using the modulo operation to ensure it falls within the valid range of combinations.

The function then calls the get_words function, passing the arrays, the total number of combinations, and the adjusted index. The get_words function retrieves the appropriate words based on the index, which are then used to replace the placeholders in the original text. The replacement occurs sequentially for each array found in the text.

Finally, the modified text is returned, with the placeholders replaced by the selected words.

The apply_arrays function is called by the process_prompt function within the async_worker module. This relationship is significant as it allows for dynamic text generation based on user-defined prompts, enhancing the overall functionality of the application. The process_prompt function prepares the prompts for image generation tasks, utilizing apply_arrays to ensure that the prompts can include variable content based on the index provided.

**Note**: It is essential to ensure that the index provided to apply_arrays is within the bounds of the total combinations of words derived from the arrays. If the index exceeds the total combinations, it will be wrapped around using the modulo operation.

**Output Example**: For an input where text = "Generate an image of [[apple,banana,cherry]] and [[dog,elephant,fox]]", and index = 4, the output of apply_arrays would be "Generate an image of banana and elephant".
