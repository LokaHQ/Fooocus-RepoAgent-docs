## FunctionDef load_file_from_url(url)
**load_file_from_url**: The function of load_file_from_url is to download a file from a specified URL into a designated directory, utilizing a cached version if available.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
路 url: A string representing the URL from which the file will be downloaded.
路 model_dir: A string specifying the directory where the file should be saved.
路 progress: A boolean indicating whether to show download progress (default is True).
路 file_name: An optional string that defines the name of the file to be saved. If not provided, the file name will be derived from the URL.

**Code Description**: The load_file_from_url function is designed to facilitate the downloading of files from the internet, specifically from a URL that points to a resource hosted on Hugging Face. It first checks for an environment variable that may specify an alternative mirror for Hugging Face, defaulting to "https://huggingface.co" if none is found. The function then ensures that the specified model directory exists, creating it if necessary.

If the file name is not provided, the function extracts it from the URL. It constructs the absolute path for the cached file in the specified model directory. Before downloading, it checks if the file already exists at that location. If the file is not present, it proceeds to download the file using the `download_url_to_file` function from the Torch Hub, optionally displaying the download progress.

This function is called in several parts of the project, primarily within model loading and inference processes. For instance, in the `predict_with_caption` method of the `GroundingDinoModel` class, load_file_from_url is used to download a model checkpoint if it is not already loaded. Similarly, in the `interrogate` method of the `Interrogator` class, it downloads a pre-trained model file for image captioning. The function is also utilized in various downloading functions within the `modules/config.py` file, ensuring that necessary model files are fetched and stored correctly for later use.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the specified model directory has appropriate write permissions. Additionally, users should be aware that the function relies on the availability of the specified URL and that network issues may affect the download process.

**Output Example**: An example return value from the function could be a string representing the absolute path to the downloaded file, such as "/path/to/model_dir/groundingdino_swint_ogc.pth".
