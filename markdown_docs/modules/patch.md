## FunctionDef calculate_weight_patched(self, patches, weight, key)
**calculate_weight_patched**: The function of calculate_weight_patched is to compute and update the weight tensor based on a series of patches and their associated parameters.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· patches: A list of tuples, where each tuple contains parameters for a specific patch, including alpha, a value or tensor, and a strength model.
· weight: A tensor representing the current weight that will be modified based on the patches.
· key: A string identifier used for logging and debugging purposes.

**Code Description**: The calculate_weight_patched function iterates through a list of patches, applying transformations to the weight tensor based on the characteristics of each patch. Each patch is represented as a tuple containing an alpha value, a value or tensor (v), and a strength model. The function first checks the strength model; if it is not equal to 1.0, the weight is scaled accordingly.

The function then determines the type of patch based on the structure of v. If v is a list, it recursively calculates the weight for the sublist, using the first element as a reference. The patch types include "diff", "lora", "fooocus", "lokr", "loha", and "glora", each requiring specific handling.

For the "diff" patch type, the function checks for shape mismatches and updates the weight by adding a scaled version of the tensor. The "lora" patch type involves matrix multiplications and may adjust the alpha value based on additional parameters. The "fooocus" type normalizes a tensor and applies it to the weight if the alpha is non-zero. The "lokr" and "loha" types involve more complex tensor operations, including Kronecker products and tensor contractions, while the "glora" type combines multiple matrix multiplications.

Throughout the function, the cast_to_device function is called to ensure that tensors are on the correct device and have the appropriate data type, facilitating efficient computation. This function is crucial for managing device compatibility, especially in GPU contexts.

The calculate_weight_patched function is called within the patch_all function, which is responsible for applying various patches to the model. By replacing the original calculate_weight method of the ModelPatcher class with calculate_weight_patched, the patch_all function ensures that all weight calculations utilize the updated logic defined in calculate_weight_patched.

**Note**: It is essential to ensure that the shapes of the tensors being merged are compatible to avoid runtime warnings or errors. Additionally, the alpha parameter plays a critical role in scaling the contributions of each patch, and its value should be carefully managed based on the context of the patches being applied.

**Output Example**: A possible return value of the function could be a tensor that has been modified based on the applied patches, for example, a tensor of shape (128, 256) representing the updated weights after processing all patches.
## ClassDef BrownianTreeNoiseSamplerPatched
**BrownianTreeNoiseSamplerPatched**: The function of BrownianTreeNoiseSamplerPatched is to provide a patched implementation of the Brownian Tree noise sampling technique for use in diffusion models.

**attributes**: The attributes of this Class.
· transform: A static attribute that holds a transformation function to be applied to the sigma values.
· tree: A static attribute that holds an instance of BatchedBrownianTree, which is used for generating noise samples.

**Code Description**: The BrownianTreeNoiseSamplerPatched class is designed to facilitate the generation of noise samples using a Brownian Tree approach, which is particularly useful in the context of diffusion models. This class contains a static method `global_init` that initializes the noise sampler with specific parameters, including the input tensor `x`, minimum and maximum sigma values, an optional seed for randomness, a transformation function, and a flag indicating whether to use CPU processing.

The `global_init` method first checks if DirectML is enabled, which influences the CPU flag. It then transforms the minimum and maximum sigma values using the provided transformation function. After that, it assigns the transformation function and creates an instance of `BatchedBrownianTree` with the specified parameters, storing it in the static attribute `tree`.

The class also includes a static method `__call__`, which allows instances of the class to be called as functions. This method takes two sigma values, `sigma` and `sigma_next`, applies the transformation function to them, and uses the `tree` instance to generate a noise sample. The output is normalized by the square root of the absolute difference between `t1` and `t0`, ensuring that the generated noise is appropriately scaled.

The BrownianTreeNoiseSamplerPatched class is utilized within the `process_diffusion` function found in the `modules/default_pipeline.py` file. In this context, it is called to initialize the noise sampler with the latent samples and calculated sigma values before proceeding with the diffusion process. The initialization ensures that the noise generation is consistent and tailored to the specific parameters of the diffusion model being used.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the `global_init` method is called before using the `__call__` method to generate noise samples. Additionally, the transformation function should be defined according to the specific requirements of the application to ensure proper scaling of the sigma values.

**Output Example**: A possible output of the `__call__` method could be a tensor representing the generated noise, which might look like this: 
```
tensor([[0.1234, -0.5678],
        [0.9101, -0.1121]])
```
### FunctionDef global_init(x, sigma_min, sigma_max, seed, transform, cpu)
**global_init**: The function of global_init is to initialize the BrownianTreeNoiseSamplerPatched with the specified parameters for generating Brownian noise.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· x: A tensor representing the initial state or input for the Brownian tree process.  
· sigma_min: The minimum value for the noise scale, transformed into a tensor.  
· sigma_max: The maximum value for the noise scale, transformed into a tensor.  
· seed: An optional parameter that specifies the random seed for generating the Brownian motion.  
· transform: A function that transforms the sigma_min and sigma_max values, defaulting to the identity function (lambda x: x).  
· cpu: A boolean indicating whether to create the Brownian trees on the CPU, defaulting to False.

**Code Description**: The global_init function is responsible for setting up the BrownianTreeNoiseSamplerPatched by initializing its transformation and creating an instance of the BatchedBrownianTree class. It first checks if the DirectML (a library for GPU acceleration) is enabled, and if so, it sets the cpu parameter to True, indicating that the computations should be performed on the CPU.

The function then transforms the sigma_min and sigma_max parameters into tensors using the provided transform function. These transformed values are assigned to t0 and t1, which represent the starting and ending times for the Brownian motion, respectively.

Next, the function assigns the transform function to the BrownianTreeNoiseSamplerPatched class, allowing it to utilize this transformation in its operations. It then creates an instance of the BatchedBrownianTree class, passing in the initial state tensor x, the transformed time parameters t0 and t1, the seed, and the cpu flag. This instance is stored in the BrownianTreeNoiseSamplerPatched class, enabling the generation of Brownian motion paths that are crucial for noise sampling in diffusion processes.

The global_init function is called within the process_diffusion function, which is part of the default pipeline for processing diffusion models. In this context, global_init is invoked after calculating the minimum and maximum sigma values based on the specified sampler and scheduler. The initial latent tensor is passed to global_init along with the computed sigma values and an optional seed for randomness. This integration ensures that the Brownian noise generation is properly initialized before the diffusion process begins.

**Note**: When using the global_init function, ensure that the input tensor x and the sigma parameters are correctly defined. The seed parameter can be specified to control the randomness of the Brownian motion generation. Additionally, be aware of the implications of setting the cpu parameter, as it may affect performance depending on the hardware configuration.
***
### FunctionDef __init__(self)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize an instance of the class.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· *args: A variable length argument list that allows passing a non-keyworded, variable number of arguments to the function.
· **kwargs: A variable length keyword argument dictionary that allows passing a non-keyworded, variable number of keyword arguments to the function.

**Code Description**: The __init__ function serves as the constructor for the class. It is designed to accept any number of positional and keyword arguments, indicated by the use of *args and **kwargs. However, the function body is currently empty, which means that it does not perform any operations or initializations upon the creation of an instance. This design allows for flexibility in the future, as developers can implement specific initialization logic as needed without altering the function signature. The use of *args and **kwargs suggests that this class may be intended to inherit from or interact with other classes that require various parameters, but without additional context or implementation details, the exact purpose remains undefined.

**Note**: It is important to implement the necessary initialization logic within this function to ensure that instances of the class are properly configured. Leaving the function empty may lead to instances that do not behave as expected if they rely on certain attributes or states to be initialized.
***
### FunctionDef __call__(sigma, sigma_next)
**__call__**: The function of __call__ is to compute a normalized Brownian tree noise value based on two input parameters.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· parameter1: sigma - A tensor representing the current state or value in the Brownian tree noise sampling process.
· parameter2: sigma_next - A tensor representing the next state or value in the Brownian tree noise sampling process.

**Code Description**: The __call__ function is designed to facilitate the computation of a normalized Brownian tree noise value by taking two input tensors, sigma and sigma_next. It first retrieves the transform and tree attributes from the BrownianTreeNoiseSamplerPatched class. The function then applies the transform to both sigma and sigma_next, converting them into tensors using `torch.as_tensor`. The transformed values, t0 and t1, represent the transformed states corresponding to sigma and sigma_next, respectively. 

Subsequently, the function computes the tree noise by calling the tree function with t0 and t1 as arguments. The result of this computation is then normalized by dividing it by the square root of the absolute difference between t1 and t0, specifically `(t1 - t0).abs().sqrt()`. This normalization ensures that the output is scaled appropriately, accounting for the distance between the two transformed states.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that sigma and sigma_next are valid tensors and that the transformation applied does not lead to any undefined operations, such as division by zero. Proper handling of edge cases should be considered when using this function.

**Output Example**: An example return value of the function could be a tensor representing the normalized Brownian tree noise, such as `tensor([0.5])`, indicating a specific noise value based on the input parameters.
***
## FunctionDef compute_cfg(uncond, cond, cfg_scale, t)
**compute_cfg**: The function of compute_cfg is to compute a conditional guidance factor based on unconditional and conditional inputs, scaling factors, and a time parameter.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· uncond: A tensor representing the unconditional input, which serves as a baseline for the computation.
· cond: A tensor representing the conditional input, which is used to modify the unconditional input based on the guidance scale.
· cfg_scale: A float that determines the strength of the conditional guidance applied to the unconditional input.
· t: A float representing a time parameter that influences the blending of the real and mimicked outputs.

**Code Description**: The compute_cfg function calculates a modified output based on the provided unconditional and conditional inputs. It first retrieves the process ID and uses it to access adaptive configuration settings specific to that process. The function computes a real output (real_eps) by adjusting the unconditional input with the conditional input scaled by cfg_scale. 

If the cfg_scale exceeds the adaptive configuration value for the process, the function further computes a mimicked output (mimicked_eps) using the adaptive configuration value. The final output is a weighted combination of the real and mimicked outputs, where the weight is determined by the time parameter t. If the cfg_scale is not greater than the adaptive configuration, the function simply returns the real output.

This function is called within the patched_sampling_function, where it is used to refine the estimated noise (final_eps) based on the conditional and unconditional inputs. The patched_sampling_function first calculates positive and negative estimates of the conditional and unconditional inputs, then applies an adaptive filter to the positive estimate. The final noise estimate is computed using compute_cfg, which integrates the effects of both the positive and negative estimates, adjusted by the conditional scale and the global diffusion progress. This integration is crucial for generating high-quality outputs in the sampling process.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the cfg_scale parameter is set appropriately to leverage the adaptive configuration settings effectively. The time parameter t should also be chosen carefully to balance the influence of the real and mimicked outputs.

**Output Example**: A possible return value of the compute_cfg function could be a tensor that represents the adjusted noise estimate, which may look like: tensor([0.5, 0.3, 0.7]).
## FunctionDef patched_sampling_function(model, x, timestep, uncond, cond, cond_scale, model_options, seed)
**patched_sampling_function**: The function of patched_sampling_function is to perform a refined sampling operation using conditional and unconditional inputs, applying various processing techniques to enhance the output quality.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· model: The model to which the inputs will be passed for processing.
· x: The input tensor that serves as the base for the model's predictions.
· timestep: A tensor representing the current timestep, which is essential for temporal processing.
· uncond: A list of unconditional inputs that are used alongside the conditionals.
· cond: A list of conditional inputs that influence the model's output.
· cond_scale: A float that determines the strength of the conditional guidance applied to the unconditional input.
· model_options: A dictionary containing additional options and configurations for the model (optional).
· seed: An optional parameter for random seed initialization.

**Code Description**: The patched_sampling_function begins by retrieving the process ID using os.getpid(). It first checks if the conditional scale (cond_scale) is close to 1.0 and whether the optimization for CFG1 is disabled. If both conditions are satisfied, it calculates the final output tensor (final_x0) using the calc_cond_uncond_batch function, which processes the model with the provided conditional inputs and returns the first output tensor.

If the eps_record for the current process is not None, it updates this record with the computed epsilon values based on the difference between the input tensor (x) and the final_x0, normalized by the timestep.

In cases where the conditions for the first optimization are not met, the function proceeds to calculate both positive and negative estimates of the conditional and unconditional inputs by calling calc_cond_uncond_batch again. It computes the positive and negative epsilon values by subtracting the respective outputs from the input tensor (x).

Next, the function applies an adaptive anisotropic filter to the positive epsilon values using the adaptive_anisotropic_filter function. This filtering process helps in achieving edge-preserving smoothing, which is crucial for maintaining the quality of the output.

The function then computes the final epsilon values using the compute_cfg function, which integrates the effects of both the positive and negative estimates, adjusted by the conditional scale and the global diffusion progress.

If the eps_record is not None, it updates the record with the final epsilon values normalized by the timestep. Finally, the function returns the adjusted input tensor (x) after subtracting the final epsilon values, resulting in a refined output.

The patched_sampling_function is called within the patch_all function, where it replaces the original sampling_function. This integration allows for enhanced sampling capabilities in the model, leveraging the optimizations and processing techniques defined within patched_sampling_function.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the input tensor x has the correct dimensions and that the conditions provided in cond and uncond are valid to avoid runtime errors. The function assumes that the model is properly configured and that the necessary memory is available on the device before execution.

**Output Example**: A possible return value of the function could be a tensor representing the adjusted input, which may look like: tensor([[0.5, 0.3], [0.2, 0.1]]).
## FunctionDef round_to_64(x)
**round_to_64**: The function of round_to_64 is to round a given number to the nearest multiple of 64.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· x: A numeric value that needs to be rounded to the nearest multiple of 64.

**Code Description**: The round_to_64 function takes a single parameter, x, which is expected to be a numeric value. The function first converts this value into a float to ensure that any decimal values are handled correctly. It then divides the float value by 64.0, effectively scaling the number down to a range where rounding can be applied. The round function is used to round this scaled value to the nearest integer. After rounding, the integer is multiplied back by 64 to return it to the original scale, but now as a multiple of 64. The final result is returned as an integer.

This function is utilized within the sdxl_encode_adm_patched method, where it is called to round the target width and height values to the nearest multiples of 64. This is important in contexts where dimensions need to conform to specific requirements, such as in image processing or graphical applications, where certain operations may only accept dimensions that are multiples of 64 for optimal performance or compatibility. By ensuring that the width and height are rounded appropriately, the sdxl_encode_adm_patched method can proceed with further processing without encountering issues related to dimension mismatches.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the input to round_to_64 is a numeric type, as the function expects to perform arithmetic operations on the input. Non-numeric inputs may lead to errors during execution.

**Output Example**: If the input value is 130, the function will return 128, as it is the nearest multiple of 64. If the input value is 150, the function will return 128 as well, since it is closer to 128 than to 192.
## FunctionDef sdxl_encode_adm_patched(self)
**sdxl_encode_adm_patched**: The function of sdxl_encode_adm_patched is to process input parameters and generate an augmented tensor representation based on specified dimensions and conditioning types.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· self: The instance of the class that contains this method, providing access to its attributes and methods.
· kwargs: A dictionary containing various input parameters, including optional width, height, prompt type, and other relevant settings.

**Code Description**: The sdxl_encode_adm_patched function begins by invoking the ldm_patched.modules.model_base.sdxl_pooled function to obtain a pooled representation of the input data, utilizing the noise_augmentor associated with the instance. The width and height are extracted from the kwargs dictionary, defaulting to 1024 if not provided. The function then checks the "prompt_type" key in kwargs to determine if the dimensions should be scaled based on negative or positive conditioning. The scaling factors are retrieved from the patch_settings dictionary, indexed by the current process ID (pid).

An inner function, embedder, is defined to create embeddings based on a list of numerical inputs. This function utilizes the instance's embedder method to generate embeddings, which are then flattened and repeated to match the number of pooled clips.

The width and height are converted to integers, and the target dimensions are rounded to the nearest multiples of 64 using the round_to_64 function. This rounding is crucial for ensuring compatibility with certain processing requirements.

Two embeddings are generated: adm_emphasized and adm_consistent, which are created by calling the embedder function with specific height and width parameters. The pooled clip representation is then converted to the same device as adm_emphasized, and a final tensor, final_adm, is constructed by concatenating the pooled clip and the two embeddings along the specified dimension.

The sdxl_encode_adm_patched function is called within the patch_all function, which is responsible for applying various patches to the model management and processing components. Specifically, it replaces the original SDXL.encode_adm method with the patched version, allowing for enhanced functionality and processing capabilities.

**Note**: It is essential to ensure that the kwargs dictionary contains the necessary parameters, such as width, height, and prompt_type, to avoid runtime errors. Additionally, the noise_augmentor must be properly initialized as it plays a critical role in the processing of the input data.

**Output Example**: A possible appearance of the code's return value could be a tensor of shape (N, C) where N corresponds to the number of pooled clips and C is the combined dimension size resulting from the concatenation of the pooled clip and embeddings. For instance, a tensor might look like:
```
tensor([[0.1, 0.2, 0.3, ..., 0.5],
        [0.4, 0.5, 0.6, ..., 0.7],
        ...])
```
### FunctionDef embedder(number_list)
**embedder**: The function of embedder is to transform a list of numbers into a tensor representation suitable for further processing.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· number_list: A list of numerical values that will be converted into a tensor.

**Code Description**: The embedder function takes a list of numbers as input, which is expected to be in a format that can be converted into a PyTorch tensor. The first operation within the function is to convert the input list, number_list, into a tensor of type float32 using the PyTorch library. This conversion is crucial as it prepares the data for subsequent operations that require tensor inputs.

After the initial conversion, the tensor is passed to another embedder method (presumably defined in the same class or module), which processes the tensor and returns a result stored in the variable h. The next step involves flattening this tensor h, which collapses all dimensions into a single dimension, making it easier to manipulate. The flattened tensor is then unsqueezed along a new dimension (dim=0), effectively adding a new dimension at the front of the tensor.

Finally, the unsqueezed tensor is repeated for the number of rows in another tensor, clip_pooled, which is assumed to be defined elsewhere in the code. This repetition creates a new tensor where the original tensor h is replicated across the specified number of rows, ensuring that the output tensor has the same number of rows as clip_pooled.

The function concludes by returning the resulting tensor h, which is now ready for further processing or analysis.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the input number_list contains numerical values that can be converted to a tensor. Additionally, the function relies on the existence of the clip_pooled tensor, which must be defined in the surrounding context for the function to execute correctly.

**Output Example**: If the input number_list is [1.0, 2.0, 3.0], the output might resemble a tensor like this: 
tensor([[1.0, 2.0, 3.0],
        [1.0, 2.0, 3.0],
        [1.0, 2.0, 3.0]]) 
assuming clip_pooled has three rows.
***
## FunctionDef patched_KSamplerX0Inpaint_forward(self, x, sigma, uncond, cond, cond_scale, denoise_mask, model_options, seed)
**patched_KSamplerX0Inpaint_forward**: The function of patched_KSamplerX0Inpaint_forward is to perform a forward pass for inpainting using a KSampler model, incorporating latent processing and energy generation based on the current task.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· self: The instance of the class that contains this method, typically representing a model or sampler.
· x: The input tensor representing the data to be processed.
· sigma: A tensor representing the noise level or variance to be applied during the inpainting process.
· uncond: A tensor representing unconditional inputs for the model.
· cond: A tensor representing conditional inputs for the model.
· cond_scale: A scaling factor for the conditional inputs.
· denoise_mask: A tensor used to specify which parts of the input should be denoised.
· model_options: A dictionary of additional options for the model (default is an empty dictionary).
· seed: An optional integer seed for random number generation (default is None).

**Code Description**: The patched_KSamplerX0Inpaint_forward function is designed to handle the forward pass of a KSampler model specifically for inpainting tasks. It first checks if there is a current task in the inpaint_worker. If a task exists, it retrieves the latent representation and mask from the current task and processes them using the inner model's latent processing function. 

To ensure consistent results, an energy generator is initialized with a modified seed if it has not been set previously. The function then reshapes the sigma tensor to match the dimensions of the input tensor x and generates random noise scaled by sigma. This noise is combined with the inpainted latent representation based on the inpaint mask, effectively blending the inpainted content with the original input.

The function then calls the inner model with the modified input tensor, sigma, and other parameters (cond, uncond, cond_scale, model_options, and seed) to produce the output. Finally, it combines the output from the inner model with the inpainted latent representation using the inpaint mask, ensuring that the final output respects the areas specified for inpainting.

This function is called within the patch_all function, which is responsible for applying various patches to the model management and sampler components of the project. Specifically, it replaces the original forward method of the KSamplerX0Inpaint class with this patched version, allowing for enhanced functionality during inpainting tasks.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the inpaint_worker has a current task set before calling this function, as the behavior of the function depends on the presence of this task. Additionally, the seed should be managed carefully to avoid inconsistencies in the generated outputs.

**Output Example**: A possible return value of this function could be a tensor of the same shape as the input x, containing the processed inpainted data, which may look like a modified version of the original input with certain areas filled in based on the inpainting logic.
## FunctionDef timed_adm(y, timesteps)
**timed_adm**: The function of timed_adm is to apply a specific adaptive masking operation to a tensor based on provided timesteps.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· y: A 2-dimensional tensor of shape (N, 5632), where N is the batch size.
· timesteps: A tensor representing the timesteps, used to determine the masking operation.

**Code Description**: The timed_adm function first checks if the input tensor y is a 2-dimensional PyTorch tensor with a specific shape (i.e., the second dimension must be 5632). If this condition is met, it proceeds to create a mask based on the timesteps. The mask is calculated by comparing the timesteps to a threshold derived from the patch settings, specifically using the process of scaling defined by the `adm_scaler_end` parameter for the current process ID. 

The function then splits the input tensor y into two parts: the first half (y_with_adm) which corresponds to the first 2816 elements, and the second half (y_without_adm) which corresponds to the remaining elements. The output tensor is computed by applying the mask to y_with_adm and combining it with y_without_adm, effectively blending the two based on the mask. If the initial condition is not satisfied, the function simply returns the input tensor y unchanged.

The timed_adm function is called within two other functions: patched_cldm_forward and patched_unet_forward. In both cases, it is used to preprocess the tensor y before further operations are performed. In patched_cldm_forward, the output of timed_adm is used in conjunction with other embeddings and modules to generate outputs for a diffusion model. Similarly, in patched_unet_forward, the function is utilized to ensure that the tensor y is appropriately modified before being processed through a series of neural network layers. This indicates that timed_adm plays a crucial role in adapting the input tensor based on the current timestep, which is essential for the functioning of the models that rely on temporal information.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the input tensor y is of the correct shape and type before calling this function, as it will not perform any operations if the conditions are not met.

**Output Example**: An example output of the function could be a tensor of the same shape as y, where the first half of the tensor has been modified according to the mask derived from the timesteps, while the second half remains unchanged. For instance, if y is a tensor of shape (2, 5632), the output could look like:
```
tensor([[..., ...],  # modified values based on the mask
        [..., ...]])  # unchanged values
```
## FunctionDef patched_cldm_forward(self, x, hint, timesteps, context, y)

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· x: A tensor representing the input data to be processed.
· hint: A tensor providing additional context or guidance for the processing.
· timesteps: A tensor representing the timesteps, which are crucial for generating embeddings and controlling the model's behavior.
· context: A tensor that provides contextual information to the processing modules.
· y: An optional tensor that may be used for additional processing; if not provided, it defaults to None.
· **kwargs: Additional keyword arguments that may be passed to the function.

**Code Description**: The patched_cldm_forward function begins by generating timestep embeddings using the timestep_embedding function, which creates sinusoidal embeddings based on the provided timesteps. These embeddings are then converted to the same data type as the input tensor x. The function retrieves the current process ID to manage settings specific to that process.

Next, the function processes the hint tensor through the input_hint_block, which combines the hint with the generated embeddings and context. If the optional tensor y is provided, it undergoes adaptive masking through the timed_adm function, which modifies y based on the timesteps.

The function initializes an empty list for outputs and a hidden state variable h, which is initially set to the input tensor x. If the model is designed to handle multiple classes (indicated by num_classes), the function asserts that the batch sizes of y and x match and adds class embeddings to the existing embeddings.

The function then iterates through the input_blocks and zero_convs, applying each module to the hidden state h while incorporating the guided hint if it is available. The outputs of these modules are collected in the outs list. After processing through the input blocks, the function passes the hidden state through the middle_block and appends the output of the middle_block_out to the outs list.

If the controlnet_softness setting for the current process is greater than zero, the function applies a scaling factor to the outputs to adjust their softness based on the process ID.

Finally, the function returns the list of outputs, which contains the processed results from the various layers.

This function is called within the patch_all function, which is responsible for applying various patches to the model, including replacing the forward methods of the ControlNet and UNetModel with the patched versions. This indicates that patched_cldm_forward plays a critical role in the model's forward processing, allowing for enhanced functionality and adaptability in handling input data.

**Note**: It is essential to ensure that the input tensors x, hint, and y (if provided) are of the correct shape and type before invoking this function, as improper inputs may lead to runtime errors or unexpected behavior.

**Output Example**: A possible appearance of the code's return value when called with appropriate input tensors might look like:
```
[tensor([[..., ...],  # output from the first module
         [..., ...],  # output from the second module
         ...],        # additional outputs
        tensor([[..., ...],  # output from the middle block
                [..., ...]])]  # output from the middle block out
```
## FunctionDef patched_unet_forward(self, x, timesteps, context, y, control, transformer_options)
**patched_unet_forward**: The function of patched_unet_forward is to perform a forward pass through a modified UNet model, incorporating various transformations and control signals based on input data and timesteps.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· x: A tensor representing the input data that will be processed through the UNet model.
· timesteps: An optional tensor indicating the current timesteps, which are used to modulate the processing of the input.
· context: An optional tensor providing additional contextual information for the model.
· y: A tensor that may represent class labels or other relevant data, which is conditionally used based on the model's configuration.
· control: A dictionary containing control signals that can influence the model's output at various stages.
· transformer_options: A dictionary of options specific to transformer layers, including settings for patches and indices.
· kwargs: Additional keyword arguments that may include parameters such as num_video_frames and image_only_indicator.

**Code Description**: The patched_unet_forward function begins by calculating the current step based on the provided timesteps, which is then used to update the global diffusion progress. It processes the tensor y using the timed_adm function, which applies an adaptive masking operation based on the timesteps. The function prepares the transformer options by storing the original shape of the input tensor and initializing the transformer index.

The function asserts that the tensor y is provided only if the model is class-conditional, ensuring that the model's configuration is respected. It then computes timestep embeddings using the timestep_embedding function, which generates sinusoidal embeddings based on the timesteps. If the model is class-conditional, it combines these embeddings with label embeddings derived from y.

The input tensor x is then passed through a series of input blocks, where each block applies transformations based on the timestep embeddings and any provided control signals. The function also allows for the application of patches to the output of these blocks, enhancing the model's flexibility. After processing through the input blocks, the function moves to the middle block, applying similar transformations.

Subsequently, the function processes the output blocks, where it combines the outputs from the input blocks with the current output tensor. It again applies control signals and patches as specified in the transformer options. Finally, the output tensor is cast to the appropriate data type, and the function either predicts codebook IDs or returns the final output tensor based on the model's configuration.

This function is called within the patch_all function, which modifies the forward method of the UNetModel to utilize the patched_unet_forward implementation. This integration allows the model to leverage the enhanced functionality provided by the patched version, ensuring that the model can adapt to various input conditions and control signals during inference.

**Note**: It is crucial to ensure that the input tensors are correctly shaped and that the control dictionary is populated with relevant signals before invoking this function. The model's behavior may vary significantly based on the provided timesteps and control signals.

**Output Example**: A possible appearance of the code's return value when called with appropriate input tensors might look like:
```
tensor([[..., ...],  # processed output values
        [..., ...]])  # processed output values
```
## FunctionDef patched_load_models_gpu
**patched_load_models_gpu**: The function of patched_load_models_gpu is to load models onto the GPU while measuring and reporting the time taken for the operation.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· *args: A variable-length argument list that can include any number of positional arguments required by the original model loading function.
· **kwargs: A variable-length keyword argument dictionary that can include any number of keyword arguments required by the original model loading function.

**Code Description**: The patched_load_models_gpu function serves as a wrapper around the original model loading function, load_models_gpu_origin, which is part of the ldm_patched.modules.model_management module. The primary purpose of this function is to enhance the original model loading process by adding timing functionality. 

When invoked, the function first records the start time of the execution using time.perf_counter(). It then calls the original model loading function, passing along any arguments and keyword arguments received. After the model loading operation completes, the function calculates the total time taken for the operation by subtracting the recorded start time from the current time. If the time taken exceeds 0.1 seconds, it prints a message to the console indicating the duration of the model loading process.

This function is called within the patch_all function, which is responsible for applying various patches to the model management system. Specifically, it replaces the original load_models_gpu function with patched_load_models_gpu. This replacement allows for the additional timing functionality to be integrated seamlessly into the model loading process, thereby providing developers with insights into performance and potential bottlenecks during model loading.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the original load_models_gpu function is available and has been assigned to load_models_gpu_origin before invoking patched_load_models_gpu. This function is designed to work in conjunction with the overall patching mechanism established in the patch_all function.

**Output Example**: A possible output when the model loading takes longer than 0.1 seconds could be:
```
[Fooocus Model Management] Moving model(s) has taken 0.25 seconds
```
## FunctionDef build_loaded(module, loader_name)
**build_loaded**: The function of build_loaded is to enhance the loading mechanism of a specified module by wrapping its loader function with error handling and file corruption management.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· parameter1: module - The module whose loader function is to be enhanced.
· parameter2: loader_name - The name of the loader function within the specified module.

**Code Description**: The build_loaded function is designed to augment the loading process of a specified module by introducing a wrapper around its original loader function. When invoked, it first constructs the name of an original loader by appending '_origin' to the provided loader_name. If the module does not already have this original loader attribute, it sets it to the current loader function.

The core of the function is a nested loader function that attempts to call the original loader with any provided arguments. If an exception occurs during this call, the function captures the exception and checks if any of the arguments or keyword arguments are file paths. For each valid file path, it checks for its existence and, if found, marks it as corrupted by renaming it with a '.corrupted' extension. The function then raises a ValueError with a detailed message indicating the corrupted files and suggests that the user may attempt to reload the models.

Finally, the build_loaded function sets the module's loader to this new wrapped loader, effectively replacing the original loader with the enhanced version. This function is called within the patch_all function, which is responsible for applying various patches to the model management system. Specifically, build_loaded is called for the 'load_file' function of the safetensors.torch module and the 'load' function of the torch module. This indicates that the loading mechanisms of these modules are critical points where enhanced error handling and file management are necessary, particularly in scenarios where file corruption may occur.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the module being patched has the specified loader function available, as the build_loaded function relies on this to function correctly. Additionally, users should be aware that if a file is marked as corrupted, it will be renamed, and they will need to reload the models as suggested in the error message.

**Output Example**: A possible appearance of the code's return value could be a ValueError with a message like:
"File corrupted: /path/to/file \n Fooocus has tried to move the corrupted file to /path/to/file.corrupted \n You may try again now and Fooocus will download models again."
### FunctionDef loader
**loader**: The function of loader is to attempt to load a resource while handling potential file corruption by backing up corrupted files.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· *args: A variable-length argument list that may include file paths or other parameters required by the original loader function.
· **kwargs: A variable-length keyword argument dictionary that may include additional parameters required by the original loader function.

**Code Description**: The loader function is designed to invoke an original loading function (referred to as `original_loader`) with the provided arguments. It captures any exceptions that occur during this process. If an exception is raised, the function initializes the result as `None` and constructs an error message that includes the exception details. It then iterates over all paths provided in both `args` and `kwargs`. For each path that is a string, it checks if the file exists. If a file is found to be corrupted, it creates a backup of the corrupted file by appending '.corrupted' to its name. The original corrupted file is then removed, and the function logs a message indicating that Fooocus has attempted to move the corrupted file. The user is informed that they may try again, and Fooocus will download the models again. Finally, a `ValueError` is raised with the constructed error message. If no exceptions occur, the function returns the result obtained from the original loader.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the paths provided in the arguments are valid and accessible. The function is designed to handle file corruption gracefully, but it relies on the existence of the original loader function and the proper handling of file paths.

**Output Example**: If the loader function encounters a corrupted file located at '/path/to/file', the output might resemble the following:
```
ValueError: File corrupted: /path/to/file 
Fooocus has tried to move the corrupted file to /path/to/file.corrupted 
You may try again now and Fooocus will download models again.
```

**patch_all**: The function of patch_all is to apply a series of patches and modifications to various components of the model management system, enhancing functionality and performance.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· None

**Code Description**: The patch_all function serves as a central hub for applying multiple patches to different components of the model management system. It performs several critical operations to ensure that the models and their associated methods are updated with the latest enhancements.

1. **Model Management Adjustments**: The function first checks if the DirectML feature is enabled within the model management system. If it is, it sets specific flags and attributes to optimize memory usage and performance during model operations. This includes setting low VRAM availability and defining an out-of-memory exception to handle potential memory issues gracefully.

2. **Patching Precision Functions**: The patch_all function invokes the patch_all_precision function, which updates the timestep embedding and schedule registration methods in the diffusion model to their patched versions. This ensures that the model utilizes the most accurate and efficient methods for processing timesteps and managing schedules.

3. **Patching CLIP Model Components**: The function also calls patch_all_clip, which applies various patches to the CLIP model components. This includes replacing specific methods within the ClipTokenWeightEncoder, SDClipModel, and ClipVisionModel classes with their enhanced counterparts, thereby improving their functionality and adaptability.

4. **Patching Model Loading Functions**: The patch_all function enhances the model loading process by calling build_loaded for both the safetensors.torch module and the torch module. This wrapping introduces error handling and file corruption management, ensuring that any issues encountered during model loading are appropriately addressed.

5. **Patching Sampling Functions**: The function replaces the original sampling_function with patched_sampling_function, which incorporates refined sampling operations that enhance the output quality. This allows for better handling of conditional and unconditional inputs during the sampling process.

6. **Patching UNet and ControlNet Forward Methods**: The patch_all function modifies the forward methods of the UNetModel and ControlNet classes by replacing them with their patched versions, patched_unet_forward and patched_cldm_forward, respectively. This ensures that the models leverage the latest processing techniques and optimizations during inference.

7. **Patching Weight Calculation**: The function also updates the weight calculation method used in the ModelPatcher class by replacing calculate_weight with calculate_weight_patched. This new implementation provides enhanced logic for computing and updating model weights based on a series of patches.

8. **Patching Inpainting Functionality**: The function modifies the KSamplerX0Inpaint class by replacing its forward method with patched_KSamplerX0Inpaint_forward, which incorporates latent processing and energy generation for inpainting tasks.

9. **Patching Noise Sampler**: The function updates the BrownianTreeNoiseSampler class by replacing its implementation with BrownianTreeNoiseSamplerPatched, which provides a refined noise sampling technique for diffusion models.

The patch_all function is called at the initialization phase of the model management system, ensuring that all components are properly patched before any operations are performed. This centralized approach to patching enhances the overall robustness and performance of the model management framework.

**Note**: It is essential to ensure that all patched methods are compatible with the existing model architecture and that the necessary dependencies are correctly managed to avoid runtime errors.

**Output Example**: The function does not return a value; instead, it modifies the internal methods and attributes of the model management system, leading to enhanced functionality across various components. The expected outcome is that all models and methods will now utilize the latest patched versions, improving their operational consistency and performance.
