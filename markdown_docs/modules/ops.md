## FunctionDef use_patched_ops(operations)
**use_patched_ops**: The function of use_patched_ops is to temporarily replace specific PyTorch operations with custom implementations during a context-managed block.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
Â· operations: An object that contains custom implementations of specific PyTorch operations.

**Code Description**: The use_patched_ops function is designed to facilitate the temporary replacement of certain operations in the PyTorch library, specifically 'Linear', 'Conv2d', 'Conv3d', 'GroupNorm', and 'LayerNorm'. It achieves this by first creating a backup of the original operations from the torch.nn module. The function then sets the specified operations in the torch.nn module to the corresponding operations provided in the 'operations' parameter. 

The function utilizes a context manager, indicated by the use of the 'yield' statement, which allows the replacement of operations to persist only within the scope of the context. Once the operations are no longer needed, the function ensures that the original operations are restored, maintaining the integrity of the PyTorch library for subsequent code execution.

This function is called in various parts of the project, notably within the load_ip_adapter function in the extras/ip_adapter.py file and the __init__ methods of patched models in modules/patch_clip.py. In these contexts, use_patched_ops is employed to apply custom operations during the initialization of models, ensuring that the models can leverage the modified behavior of these operations without permanently altering the global state of the PyTorch library. This is particularly useful when integrating new functionalities or optimizations that are not part of the standard PyTorch operations.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the operations provided to use_patched_ops are compatible with the expected behavior of the original PyTorch operations to avoid runtime errors.

**Output Example**: The function does not return a value but allows the code within its context to execute with the patched operations. An example of its usage would be:
```python
with use_patched_ops(custom_operations):
    # Code that utilizes the patched operations
```
