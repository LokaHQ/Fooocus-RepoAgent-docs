## FunctionDef try_load_sorted_styles(style_names, default_selected)
**try_load_sorted_styles**: The function of try_load_sorted_styles is to load and sort style names based on a predefined order stored in a JSON file, while ensuring that default selected styles are prioritized.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· style_names: A list of all available style names that can be used in the application.
· default_selected: A list of style names that should be prioritized and selected by default.

**Code Description**: The try_load_sorted_styles function begins by declaring a global variable, all_styles, which is assigned the value of the style_names parameter. The function then attempts to load a JSON file named 'sorted_styles.json'. If this file exists, it reads the contents and constructs a new list, sorted_styles, which includes styles that are present in both the loaded JSON data and the all_styles list. 

The function ensures that any styles not found in the sorted_styles list are appended to the end of this list, maintaining the original order of styles while prioritizing those defined in the JSON file. If an error occurs during this process, an exception is caught, and an error message is printed to the console.

After loading and sorting the styles, the function creates a new list, unselected, which contains styles from all_styles that are not included in the default_selected list. Finally, the all_styles variable is updated to reflect the order where default_selected styles appear first, followed by any unselected styles.

This function is called by the webui.py module, which suggests that it plays a role in the user interface of the application, likely influencing how styles are presented to the user. By ensuring that default styles are prioritized, the function enhances user experience by maintaining consistency in style selection.

**Note**: When using this function, ensure that the 'sorted_styles.json' file is correctly formatted and accessible to avoid loading errors. Additionally, the function does not return any value, but it modifies the global variable all_styles directly.

**Output Example**: An example of the all_styles variable after execution might look like this: 
['DefaultStyle', 'CustomStyle1', 'CustomStyle2', 'Style3', 'Style4'] 
where 'DefaultStyle' and 'CustomStyle1' were part of the default_selected list, and the remaining styles were appended in their original order.
## FunctionDef sort_styles(selected)
**sort_styles**: The function of sort_styles is to sort a list of styles based on user selection and save the sorted list to a JSON file.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· selected: A list of styles that have been selected by the user.

**Code Description**: The sort_styles function takes a list of selected styles as input and performs several operations to sort and manage the styles. It first utilizes a global variable, all_styles, which presumably contains all available styles. The function creates a new list, unselected, that consists of styles from all_styles that are not present in the selected list. It then combines the selected styles with the unselected styles to form a new list, sorted_styles.

The function attempts to write this sorted_styles list to a file named 'sorted_styles.json' in a human-readable format (with indentation for clarity). If the file writing process encounters any exceptions, it prints an error message indicating that the write operation failed, along with the exception details. After successfully writing to the file, the function updates the global all_styles variable to reflect the new sorted order.

Finally, the function returns an updated CheckboxGroup object with the new choices set to sorted_styles. This return value is likely intended for use in a user interface, allowing users to see the newly sorted styles.

The sort_styles function is called by the webui.py module, which suggests that it plays a role in the user interface of the application. Specifically, it likely responds to user interactions where styles are selected, ensuring that the interface reflects the current state of style selection and organization.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the global variable all_styles is properly initialized before calling this function, as the function relies on it to determine which styles are selected and unselected. Additionally, the function assumes that the file system is accessible for writing the JSON file.

**Output Example**: A possible appearance of the code's return value could be:
```json
{
    "choices": [
        "Style1",
        "Style2",
        "Style3",
        "Style4",
        "Style5"
    ]
}
```
## FunctionDef localization_key(x)
**localization_key**: The function of localization_key is to retrieve a localized string based on the provided key, appending the current translation if available.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· parameter1: x - A string representing the key for which the localized translation is sought.

**Code Description**: The localization_key function takes a single parameter, x, which is expected to be a string. It attempts to retrieve a localized version of this string by accessing a dictionary named current_translation from a localization module. If the key x exists in this dictionary, its corresponding value (the translation) is returned. If the key does not exist, an empty string is appended to x, effectively returning the original string x. This function is particularly useful in applications where user interface elements need to be displayed in different languages, allowing for dynamic localization based on the current context.

The localization_key function is called within the search_styles function, which is responsible for filtering and sorting a list of styles based on user input. In search_styles, the function is used to match the query against the localized names of styles. Specifically, it converts both the style name and the query to lowercase to ensure the search is case-insensitive. If the query is not empty, it constructs a list of matched styles that contain the query string in their localized form. This integration highlights the importance of localization_key in ensuring that the search functionality respects the user's language preferences.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the localization module is properly initialized and that the current_translation dictionary contains the necessary keys for effective localization. If the keys are missing, the function will simply return the original string without any translation.

**Output Example**: If the input x is "submit_button" and the current_translation dictionary contains {"submit_button": "Enviar"}, the function will return "Enviar". If the key does not exist, such as "unknown_key", the function will return "unknown_key".
## FunctionDef search_styles(selected, query)
**search_styles**: The function of search_styles is to filter and sort a list of styles based on a user-provided query, returning an updated checkbox group of choices.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· parameter1: selected - A list of styles that are currently selected by the user.
· parameter2: query - A string representing the search term used to filter the styles.

**Code Description**: The search_styles function is designed to manage a list of styles by filtering them according to a user-defined search query. It begins by creating a list of unselected styles, which are those that are not included in the selected list. This is achieved through a list comprehension that iterates over a predefined list of all_styles.

Next, the function checks if the query is non-empty (after removing spaces) and, if so, it constructs a list of matched styles. This is done by filtering the unselected styles to find those that contain the query string in their localized form. The localization_key function is utilized here to ensure that the search is case-insensitive and respects the user's language preferences. The matched styles are then combined with the originally selected styles and any unmatched styles to create a final sorted list of styles.

The final output of the function is an update to a CheckboxGroup component, which is likely part of a user interface, reflecting the newly sorted list of styles. This function is called from the webui.py module, where it is presumably used to update the UI based on user interactions, such as typing in a search box.

**Note**: It is essential to ensure that the localization module is properly set up and that the current_translation dictionary contains the necessary keys for effective localization. If the keys are missing, the function will still operate but may not provide the intended localized results.

**Output Example**: If the selected styles are ["style1", "style2"] and the query is "style", the function might return a CheckboxGroup with choices like ["style1", "style2", "style3", "style4"], where "style3" and "style4" are unselected styles that match the query.
