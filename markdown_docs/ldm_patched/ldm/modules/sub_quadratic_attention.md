**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· x: A Tensor from which a slice will be extracted.
· starts: A List[int] indicating the starting indices for each dimension of the tensor.
· sizes: A List[int] indicating the sizes of the slices to be extracted for each dimension.

**Code Description**: The dynamic_slice function takes a tensor `x`, along with two lists: `starts` and `sizes`. It constructs a list of slice objects using a list comprehension, where each slice is defined by a start index and a corresponding size. The slicing is performed by zipping the `starts` and `sizes` lists together, allowing for the extraction of a sub-tensor that corresponds to the specified dimensions. The resulting slices are then applied to the tensor `x`, returning the sliced tensor.

This function is utilized in the project within the context of attention mechanisms, specifically in the functions `chunk_scanner` and `get_query_chunk`. In `chunk_scanner`, dynamic_slice is called to extract key and value chunks from the tensors `key_t` and `value`, respectively. The slices are determined by the current chunk index and predefined sizes, allowing for efficient processing of attention chunks. Similarly, in `get_query_chunk`, dynamic_slice is employed to extract a specific chunk of the query tensor based on the chunk index and the sizes of the query dimensions. This modular approach facilitates the handling of large tensors by breaking them down into manageable pieces for further computation in attention mechanisms.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the lengths of the `starts` and `sizes` lists match the number of dimensions of the tensor `x` to avoid index errors.

**Output Example**: If the input tensor `x` is a 3D tensor of shape (4, 5, 6), and the `starts` is [1, 2, 0] and `sizes` is [2, 3, 6], the return value of dynamic_slice would be a tensor of shape (2, 3, 6) containing the elements from the specified slice of the original tensor.
