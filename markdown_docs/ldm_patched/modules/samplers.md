## FunctionDef get_area_and_mult(conds, x_in, timestep_in)
**get_area_and_mult**: The function of get_area_and_mult is to extract a specified area from an input tensor and compute a multiplicative mask based on given conditions.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· conds: A dictionary containing various conditions that influence the area extraction and mask generation.
· x_in: A tensor from which the area will be extracted. It is expected to have at least four dimensions.
· timestep_in: A tensor representing the current timestep, used to apply temporal conditions.

**Code Description**: The get_area_and_mult function begins by initializing the area to be extracted from the input tensor x_in and setting a default strength for the mask. It checks for specific conditions in the conds dictionary, such as 'timestep_start', 'timestep_end', 'area', and 'strength', which modify the behavior of the function. If the current timestep does not meet the specified conditions, the function returns None.

If the 'area' condition is provided, it updates the area variable accordingly. The function then extracts the relevant slice from x_in based on the defined area. If a mask is specified in conds, it is resized to match the input dimensions and scaled by a mask strength if provided. If no mask is specified, a tensor of ones is created to serve as the mask.

The function computes a multiplicative mask (mult) by multiplying the mask with the strength. If no mask is present, it applies a gradual scaling effect to the edges of the area to create a smooth transition. This is done by iterating over the edges and adjusting the multiplicative values.

Next, the function prepares a conditioning dictionary by processing any model conditions specified in conds. It also checks for any control parameters and prepares patches if 'gligen' conditions are present.

Finally, the function returns a named tuple containing the extracted input tensor, the multiplicative mask, the conditioning dictionary, the area, any control parameters, and the patches. 

This function is called by calc_cond_uncond_batch, which manages batches of conditional and unconditional inputs for a model. Within calc_cond_uncond_batch, get_area_and_mult is invoked multiple times to process each condition and unconditional input, accumulating results for further model application. This relationship highlights the function's role in preparing data for model inference, ensuring that the input is appropriately conditioned based on the specified parameters.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the input tensor x_in has the correct dimensions and that the conditions provided in conds are valid to avoid runtime errors. The function assumes that the mask, if provided, has been resized appropriately before being passed in.

**Output Example**: An example of the return value from get_area_and_mult could be a named tuple structured as follows:
```
cond_obj(input_x=<extracted_tensor>, mult=<mask_tensor>, conditioning=<conditioning_dict>, area=<area_tuple>, control=<control_param>, patches=<patches_dict>)
```
## FunctionDef cond_equal_size(c1, c2)
**cond_equal_size**: The function of cond_equal_size is to determine if two conditioning objects are equal in size and compatible for concatenation.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· parameter1: c1 - The first conditioning object to compare.
· parameter2: c2 - The second conditioning object to compare.

**Code Description**: The cond_equal_size function performs a series of checks to ascertain whether two conditioning objects, c1 and c2, are equivalent in terms of their structure and compatibility for concatenation. 

1. The function first checks if c1 and c2 are the same object in memory using the identity operator `is`. If they are the same, it immediately returns True.
2. Next, it compares the keys of both conditioning objects. If the keys are not identical, it returns False, indicating that the two objects cannot be considered equal.
3. The function then iterates over each key in c1. For each key, it checks if the corresponding values in c1 and c2 can be concatenated by invoking the `can_concat` method on the value from c1, passing the value from c2 as an argument. If any pair of values cannot be concatenated, the function returns False.
4. If all checks pass, the function concludes that the two conditioning objects are equal in size and compatible for concatenation, returning True.

This function is called by the can_concat_cond function, which is responsible for determining if two objects, c1 and c2, can be concatenated based on their input shapes and other properties. Specifically, can_concat_cond first checks if the input shapes of c1 and c2 are the same. If they are not, it returns False. It then checks the compatibility of the control and patches attributes of both objects using the objects_concatable helper function. Finally, it calls cond_equal_size to verify if the conditioning attributes of c1 and c2 are equal in size and compatible for concatenation. Thus, cond_equal_size plays a crucial role in the overall logic of determining concatenation compatibility between two objects.

**Note**: When using this function, ensure that the conditioning objects passed as parameters are properly structured and contain the necessary methods for compatibility checks.

**Output Example**: If c1 and c2 are two conditioning objects with identical keys and compatible values, the return value would be True. Conversely, if they differ in keys or any values are incompatible, the return value would be False.
## FunctionDef can_concat_cond(c1, c2)
**can_concat_cond**: The function of can_concat_cond is to determine if two conditioning objects can be concatenated based on their input shapes and other properties.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· parameter1: c1 - The first conditioning object to compare.
· parameter2: c2 - The second conditioning object to compare.

**Code Description**: The can_concat_cond function evaluates whether two conditioning objects, c1 and c2, can be concatenated. The function begins by checking if the input shapes of c1 and c2 are identical. If they differ, the function immediately returns False, indicating that concatenation is not possible.

Next, the function defines a helper function named objects_concatable, which checks the compatibility of two objects. This helper function first verifies if both objects are either None or not None. If one is None and the other is not, it returns False. If both are not None, it checks if they are the same object in memory. If they are not, it also returns False. This ensures that both objects are either compatible or identical.

The can_concat_cond function then uses objects_concatable to check the compatibility of the control and patches attributes of both conditioning objects. If either of these checks fails, the function returns False.

Finally, the function calls cond_equal_size, which is responsible for determining if the conditioning attributes of c1 and c2 are equal in size and compatible for concatenation. If all checks pass, can_concat_cond returns True, indicating that c1 and c2 can be concatenated.

This function is called by calc_cond_uncond_batch, which is responsible for processing batches of conditioning and unconditional inputs. Within calc_cond_uncond_batch, can_concat_cond is utilized to determine if multiple conditioning objects can be combined into a single batch. This is crucial for optimizing memory usage and ensuring that the model processes inputs efficiently.

**Note**: When using this function, ensure that the conditioning objects passed as parameters are properly structured and contain the necessary attributes for compatibility checks.

**Output Example**: If c1 and c2 are two conditioning objects with identical input shapes, compatible control and patches attributes, and equal-sized conditioning attributes, the return value would be True. Conversely, if any of these conditions are not met, the return value would be False.
### FunctionDef objects_concatable(obj1, obj2)
**objects_concatable**: The function of objects_concatable is to determine if two objects can be concatenated based on their values.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· parameter1: obj1 - The first object to be compared for concatenation compatibility.
· parameter2: obj2 - The second object to be compared for concatenation compatibility.

**Code Description**: The function objects_concatable takes two parameters, obj1 and obj2, and evaluates whether they can be considered concatenatable. The first condition checks if one of the objects is None while the other is not. If this is true, the function returns False, indicating that the two objects cannot be concatenated. The next condition checks if both objects are not None. If they are not the same object (i.e., they are distinct instances), the function again returns False. If both objects are either None or the same object, the function returns True, indicating that they can be concatenated.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the objects being compared are of compatible types for concatenation in the broader context of their use. The function does not perform type checking beyond the None comparison and identity check.

**Output Example**: 
- objects_concatable(None, None) would return True.
- objects_concatable(None, "string") would return False.
- objects_concatable("string", "string") would return True.
- objects_concatable("string", "another_string") would return False.
***
## FunctionDef cond_cat(c_list)
**cond_cat**: The function of cond_cat is to concatenate conditional tensors from a list of dictionaries based on their keys.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· c_list: A list of dictionaries where each dictionary contains tensors associated with specific keys.

**Code Description**: The cond_cat function processes a list of dictionaries (c_list) that contain tensors. It initializes three lists to hold intermediate results and a variable to track the maximum length of cross-attention tensors. The function then iterates through each dictionary in the input list, extracting the tensors associated with each key and storing them in a temporary dictionary (temp). For each key in temp, the function concatenates the tensors from the list of tensors associated with that key, using the first tensor as the base and concatenating the rest. The result is stored in the output dictionary (out), which is then returned.

This function is called by the calc_cond_uncond_batch function, which is responsible for processing batches of conditional and unconditional inputs for a model. Within calc_cond_uncond_batch, the cond_cat function is invoked to concatenate the conditioning tensors before they are passed to the model for further processing. This integration ensures that the model receives a properly formatted input that combines all relevant conditioning information, facilitating effective model inference.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the tensors being concatenated are compatible in terms of dimensions, as any mismatch may lead to runtime errors during the concatenation process.

**Output Example**: An example of the output from cond_cat could be a dictionary where each key corresponds to a unique key from the input dictionaries, and the value is a concatenated tensor. For instance:
```python
{
    'key1': tensor([[...], [...], ...]),
    'key2': tensor([[...], [...], ...]),
    ...
}
```
## FunctionDef calc_cond_uncond_batch(model, cond, uncond, x_in, timestep, model_options)
**calc_cond_uncond_batch**: The function of calc_cond_uncond_batch is to process batches of conditional and unconditional inputs for a model, returning the computed outputs based on the provided conditions.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· model: The model to which the inputs will be passed for processing.
· cond: A list of conditional inputs that influence the model's output.
· uncond: A list of unconditional inputs that are used alongside the conditionals.
· x_in: The input tensor that serves as the base for the model's predictions.
· timestep: A tensor representing the current timestep, which is essential for temporal processing.
· model_options: A dictionary containing additional options and configurations for the model.

**Code Description**: The calc_cond_uncond_batch function begins by initializing output tensors for conditional and unconditional results, as well as counters to track the contributions from each area processed. It defines constants to differentiate between conditional (COND) and unconditional (UNCOND) inputs.

The function then prepares a list of areas to process by invoking the get_area_and_mult function for each conditional input. This function extracts the relevant area from the input tensor and computes a multiplicative mask based on the specified conditions. If unconditional inputs are provided, it similarly processes them.

Once the areas to run are determined, the function enters a loop where it processes these areas in batches. It checks if the current batch can be concatenated based on their shapes and memory availability. The function utilizes the get_free_memory function to ensure that there is sufficient memory on the device before proceeding with the model application.

The inputs for the model are prepared by concatenating the relevant tensors and conditioning information. If control parameters are present, they are processed accordingly. The model is then applied to the input tensors, and the outputs are accumulated into the respective conditional and unconditional output tensors based on their areas.

After processing all batches, the function normalizes the output tensors by dividing them by their respective counts to obtain the final results. The function returns two tensors: out_cond and out_uncond, representing the processed conditional and unconditional outputs, respectively.

This function is called by various components in the project, including the sampling_function and patched_sampling_function, which utilize calc_cond_uncond_batch to manage the processing of inputs during model inference. Additionally, it is invoked within the cfg_function and post_cfg_function, where it plays a critical role in generating the necessary predictions based on the provided conditions.

**Note**: It is crucial to ensure that the input tensor x_in has the correct dimensions and that the conditions provided in cond and uncond are valid to avoid runtime errors. The function assumes that the model is properly configured and that the necessary memory is available on the device before execution.

**Output Example**: A possible return value of the function could be:
```
(out_cond=<tensor_shape>, out_uncond=<tensor_shape>)
```
## FunctionDef sampling_function(model, x, timestep, uncond, cond, cond_scale, model_options, seed)
**sampling_function**: The function of sampling_function is to generate a sample output from a model based on conditional and unconditional inputs, applying a specified conditioning scale and additional model options.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· model: The model to which the inputs will be passed for processing.
· x: The input tensor that serves as the base for the model's predictions.
· timestep: A tensor representing the current timestep, which is essential for temporal processing.
· uncond: A list of unconditional inputs that are used alongside the conditionals.
· cond: A list of conditional inputs that influence the model's output.
· cond_scale: A scaling factor that adjusts the influence of the conditional inputs.
· model_options: A dictionary containing additional options and configurations for the model (default is an empty dictionary).
· seed: An optional seed for random number generation (default is None).

**Code Description**: The sampling_function begins by determining whether to use unconditional inputs based on the condition scale and model options. If the condition scale is close to 1.0 and the optimization flag is not set, it sets uncond_ to None; otherwise, it retains the uncond input.

Next, it calls the calc_cond_uncond_batch function, which processes the conditional and unconditional inputs, returning the predicted outputs for both. The calc_cond_uncond_batch function is critical as it handles the batch processing of inputs, ensuring that the model receives the appropriate data for generating predictions.

Following this, the sampling_function checks if a custom sampler configuration function is provided in the model options. If so, it prepares the arguments required for this function and computes the result by applying the custom function to the inputs. If no custom function is specified, it calculates the result using a standard formula that combines the unconditional and conditional predictions scaled by cond_scale.

The function then iterates over any post-processing functions specified in the model options. For each of these functions, it prepares the necessary arguments and updates the cfg_result accordingly. This allows for additional modifications to the output based on user-defined processing steps.

Finally, the function returns the processed result, cfg_result, which represents the final output of the sampling process.

The sampling_function is called by the apply_model method of the CFGNoisePredictor class, which serves as a wrapper to facilitate the model's application. It is also referenced in the patch_all function, indicating its integration into a broader framework for model management and processing.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the input tensor x has the correct dimensions and that the conditions provided in cond and uncond are valid to avoid runtime errors. The function assumes that the model is properly configured and that the necessary memory is available on the device before execution.

**Output Example**: A possible return value of the function could be:
```
<tensor_shape>
```
## ClassDef CFGNoisePredictor
**CFGNoisePredictor**: The function of CFGNoisePredictor is to serve as a wrapper around a noise prediction model, facilitating the application of the model during the sampling process.

**attributes**: The attributes of this Class.
· inner_model: This attribute holds the model that will be used for noise prediction.

**Code Description**: The CFGNoisePredictor class inherits from `torch.nn.Module`, making it compatible with PyTorch's neural network framework. The constructor `__init__` takes a model as an argument and assigns it to the `inner_model` attribute. This allows the class to encapsulate the functionality of the provided model, enabling it to be used seamlessly within the PyTorch ecosystem.

The class features a method called `apply_model`, which is responsible for executing the noise prediction. It takes several parameters: `x`, `timestep`, `cond`, `uncond`, `cond_scale`, `model_options`, and `seed`. This method calls a function named `sampling_function`, passing the `inner_model` along with the other parameters. The output of this function is returned as the result of `apply_model`.

The `forward` method is overridden to provide a standard interface for PyTorch models. It simply calls the `apply_model` method with any arguments and keyword arguments it receives. This design allows the CFGNoisePredictor to be used in the same way as any other PyTorch model, making it easy to integrate into existing workflows.

The CFGNoisePredictor class is utilized by the `wrap_model` function, which creates an instance of CFGNoisePredictor by passing a model to it. This function returns the newly created model denoiser, effectively wrapping the original model in the CFGNoisePredictor class. This relationship indicates that the wrap_model function is a convenient way to prepare a model for noise prediction tasks, ensuring that it is encapsulated within the CFGNoisePredictor framework.

**Note**: When using the CFGNoisePredictor, ensure that the model passed to it is compatible with the expected input and output formats for noise prediction tasks. Additionally, be mindful of the parameters passed to `apply_model`, as they directly influence the behavior of the noise prediction process.

**Output Example**: A possible return value from the `apply_model` method could be a tensor representing the predicted noise, shaped according to the input dimensions and the model's architecture. For instance, if the input `x` is a tensor of shape (batch_size, channels, height, width), the output might also be a tensor of the same shape, containing the predicted noise values for each pixel in the input images.
### FunctionDef __init__(self, model)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize an instance of the CFGNoisePredictor class with a specified model.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· model: An instance of the model that will be used within the CFGNoisePredictor class.

**Code Description**: The __init__ function is a constructor for the CFGNoisePredictor class. It is called when an object of this class is instantiated. The function takes one parameter, 'model', which is expected to be an instance of a model that the CFGNoisePredictor will utilize. Inside the function, the superclass's constructor is called using `super().__init__()`, which ensures that any initialization defined in the parent class is executed. Following this, the provided 'model' is assigned to the instance variable 'self.inner_model'. This assignment allows the CFGNoisePredictor to store and later use the model for its operations.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the 'model' parameter passed to the __init__ function is compatible with the expected functionality of the CFGNoisePredictor class. Proper initialization of the model is crucial for the correct operation of the class methods that may rely on 'self.inner_model'.
***
### FunctionDef apply_model(self, x, timestep, cond, uncond, cond_scale, model_options, seed)
**apply_model**: The function of apply_model is to apply a model to input data while considering both conditional and unconditional inputs, along with a specified conditioning scale.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· x: The input tensor that serves as the base for the model's predictions.  
· timestep: A tensor representing the current timestep, which is essential for temporal processing.  
· cond: A list of conditional inputs that influence the model's output.  
· uncond: A list of unconditional inputs that are used alongside the conditionals.  
· cond_scale: A scaling factor that adjusts the influence of the conditional inputs.  
· model_options: A dictionary containing additional options and configurations for the model (default is an empty dictionary).  
· seed: An optional seed for random number generation (default is None).  

**Code Description**: The apply_model function serves as a wrapper that facilitates the application of a model to the provided inputs. It calls the sampling_function, passing along the inner model, input tensor x, timestep, conditional inputs (cond), unconditional inputs (uncond), the conditioning scale (cond_scale), model options, and an optional seed for random number generation.

The sampling_function is responsible for generating a sample output from the model based on the provided inputs. It processes the conditional and unconditional inputs, applies the specified conditioning scale, and incorporates any additional model options. The function first determines whether to use the unconditional inputs based on the condition scale and model options. It then computes the predictions for both conditional and unconditional inputs through the calc_cond_uncond_batch function.

The output from the sampling_function is returned by the apply_model function, which is then utilized in the forward method of the CFGNoisePredictor class. The forward method directly calls apply_model with the same arguments, effectively serving as an interface for applying the model.

This structure indicates that apply_model is integral to the model's operation, allowing for flexible input handling and output generation based on the specified conditions and configurations.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the input tensor x has the correct dimensions and that the conditions provided in cond and uncond are valid to avoid runtime errors. The function assumes that the model is properly configured and that the necessary memory is available on the device before execution.

**Output Example**: A possible return value of the function could be:
```
<tensor_shape>
```
***
### FunctionDef forward(self)
**forward**: The function of forward is to apply the model to the input data using the specified arguments.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· *args: A variable length argument list that allows for flexible input handling.  
· **kwargs**: A variable length keyword argument dictionary that enables additional configurations to be passed to the model.

**Code Description**: The forward method serves as an interface for applying the model within the CFGNoisePredictor class. It takes a variable number of positional and keyword arguments and directly calls the apply_model method, passing these arguments along. This design allows the forward method to remain agnostic of the specific input parameters required by apply_model, thereby providing flexibility in how the model is utilized.

The apply_model method, which is invoked by forward, is responsible for processing the input data and generating predictions based on both conditional and unconditional inputs. It incorporates a variety of parameters, including the input tensor, timestep, conditional inputs, unconditional inputs, conditioning scale, model options, and an optional seed for random number generation. By delegating the actual model application to apply_model, the forward method simplifies the interface for users of the CFGNoisePredictor class.

This structure emphasizes the modularity of the code, allowing for easy adjustments to the model application process without altering the forward method itself. The forward method effectively acts as a pass-through, ensuring that all necessary parameters are forwarded to apply_model for processing.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the arguments passed to the forward method are appropriate for the apply_model function to avoid runtime errors. Users should be aware of the expected input formats and configurations to ensure successful execution.

**Output Example**: A possible return value of the function could be:
```
<tensor_shape>
```
***
## ClassDef KSamplerX0Inpaint
**KSamplerX0Inpaint**: The function of KSamplerX0Inpaint is to perform inpainting operations using a specified model while applying a denoising mask to the input data.

**attributes**: The attributes of this Class.
· inner_model: The model used for processing the input data.

**Code Description**: The KSamplerX0Inpaint class is a subclass of torch.nn.Module, designed to facilitate inpainting tasks in a neural network context. It initializes with a model that is assigned to the inner_model attribute. The forward method of this class takes multiple parameters, including the input tensor x, a noise level sigma, unconditional and conditional inputs (uncond and cond), a conditional scale (cond_scale), a denoise mask, and additional model options. 

In the forward method, if a denoise mask is provided, it computes a latent mask by subtracting the denoise mask from 1. The input tensor x is then modified by blending it with a latent image and noise, scaled by sigma, using the latent mask. This operation effectively allows the model to focus on specific areas of the input defined by the denoise mask.

The inner_model is then called with the modified input x and other parameters, producing an output. If a denoise mask is present, the output is blended with the latent image using the latent mask, ensuring that the final output respects the areas defined by the denoise mask.

The KSamplerX0Inpaint class is utilized in the sample method of the KSampler class, where it is instantiated with a model wrap. The sample method prepares the necessary parameters, including setting the latent image and noise, and then calls the KSamplerX0Inpaint instance to generate samples. This integration highlights the class's role in enhancing the sampling process by incorporating inpainting capabilities.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the denoise mask is appropriately defined to achieve the desired inpainting effect. The class assumes that the latent_image and noise attributes are set before invoking the forward method.

**Output Example**: A possible return value from the forward method could be a tensor representing the inpainted image, where specific areas have been modified according to the denoise mask, blending the original input with the latent image and noise as specified.
### FunctionDef __init__(self, model)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize an instance of the KSamplerX0Inpaint class with a specified model.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· model: This parameter represents the inner model that will be associated with the instance of the KSamplerX0Inpaint class.

**Code Description**: The __init__ function is a constructor method that is called when an instance of the KSamplerX0Inpaint class is created. It takes a single parameter, model, which is expected to be an object representing the model that the KSamplerX0Inpaint will utilize. The function first calls the constructor of its superclass using super().__init__(), ensuring that any initialization defined in the parent class is executed. Following this, it assigns the provided model to the instance variable self.inner_model. This allows the instance to store and reference the model throughout its lifecycle, enabling it to perform operations or manipulations that require the model.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the model passed to this function is compatible with the operations intended to be performed by the KSamplerX0Inpaint class. Proper validation of the model before passing it to the constructor may be necessary to avoid runtime errors.
***
### FunctionDef forward(self, x, sigma, uncond, cond, cond_scale, denoise_mask, model_options, seed)
**forward**: The function of forward is to process input data through a model while applying optional denoising based on a mask.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· x: The input tensor that represents the data to be processed.
· sigma: A tensor that indicates the level of noise to be applied.
· uncond: A tensor representing unconditional inputs for the model.
· cond: A tensor representing conditional inputs for the model.
· cond_scale: A scaling factor for the conditional inputs.
· denoise_mask: A tensor used to specify areas of the input to be denoised.
· model_options: A dictionary of additional options for the model (default is an empty dictionary).
· seed: An optional seed for random number generation (default is None).

**Code Description**: The forward function begins by checking if a denoise_mask is provided. If it is not None, the function calculates a latent_mask by subtracting the denoise_mask from 1. This latent_mask is then used to blend the input tensor x with a combination of a latent image and noise, scaled by the sigma tensor. The resulting tensor is passed to the inner model for further processing, where it utilizes the provided conditional and unconditional inputs, along with the conditional scaling and any model options specified. After the inner model processes the input, if a denoise_mask was initially provided, the output is blended back with the latent image using the latent_mask, effectively applying the denoising effect. Finally, the function returns the processed output tensor.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the dimensions of the input tensors are compatible, especially when applying the denoise_mask and blending operations. The seed parameter can be used to ensure reproducibility in stochastic processes within the model.

**Output Example**: A possible appearance of the code's return value could be a tensor of the same shape as the input x, containing processed data that has been denoised according to the specified mask and model parameters. For instance, if x is a tensor of shape (batch_size, channels, height, width), the output will also have the shape (batch_size, channels, height, width) with modified pixel values reflecting the applied transformations.
***
## FunctionDef simple_scheduler(model, steps)
**simple_scheduler**: The function of simple_scheduler is to generate a sequence of sigma values for a given model over a specified number of steps.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· parameter1: model - An object representing the model from which sigma values are derived. It contains a property `model_sampling` that holds the necessary sigma information.
· parameter2: steps - An integer indicating the number of steps over which the sigma values are to be generated.

**Code Description**: The simple_scheduler function is designed to create a list of sigma values that are evenly spaced based on the total number of steps specified. It retrieves the `model_sampling` attribute from the provided model, which contains a list of sigma values stored in `s.sigmas`. The function calculates the interval between sigma values by dividing the total number of sigma values by the number of steps. It then iterates through the range of steps, appending the appropriate sigma value to the `sigs` list by indexing into the `s.sigmas` list. The last value appended to `sigs` is 0.0, which signifies the end of the sigma sequence. Finally, the function returns the list of sigma values as a PyTorch FloatTensor.

The simple_scheduler function is called within the calculate_sigmas_scheduler and calculate_sigmas_scheduler_hacked functions. These functions determine which scheduling method to use based on the `scheduler_name` parameter. If the `scheduler_name` is "simple", the simple_scheduler function is invoked to generate the sigma values. This indicates that simple_scheduler is one of several methods for generating sigma sequences, providing flexibility in how sigma values are computed based on different scheduling strategies.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the model passed to the simple_scheduler has a properly defined `model_sampling` attribute with a valid list of sigma values. The function assumes that there are enough sigma values available to accommodate the specified number of steps.

**Output Example**: An example output of the simple_scheduler function when called with a model containing a `model_sampling` with 10 sigma values and steps set to 5 might look like this: 
```
tensor([0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.0])
``` 
This output represents a tensor of sigma values generated for the specified steps, with the last value being 0.0.
## FunctionDef ddim_scheduler(model, steps)
**ddim_scheduler**: The function of ddim_scheduler is to generate a sequence of sigma values for the DDIM (Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models) scheduler based on the specified number of steps.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· model: An object that contains the model's sampling attributes, specifically the sigmas used for sampling.
· steps: An integer representing the number of steps for which the sigma values are to be generated.

**Code Description**: The ddim_scheduler function operates by first accessing the model's sampling attributes through the `model.model_sampling` object. It initializes an empty list `sigs` to store the sigma values. The length of the `sigmas` array is divided by the number of steps to determine the interval `ss` for selecting sigma values. A while loop iterates through the `sigmas` array, starting from the second element (index 1) and incrementing by `ss` in each iteration. The selected sigma values are converted to floats and appended to the `sigs` list. After the loop, the list is reversed to arrange the sigma values in descending order, and a final value of 0.0 is appended to the list. The function then returns the `sigs` list as a PyTorch FloatTensor.

This function is called within the `calculate_sigmas_scheduler` and `calculate_sigmas_scheduler_hacked` functions. In both cases, it is invoked when the `scheduler_name` parameter is set to "ddim_uniform". This indicates that the function is part of a broader scheduling mechanism that allows for different types of sigma generation strategies based on the specified scheduler name. The output of the ddim_scheduler function is crucial for the functioning of the DDIM scheduler, which is used in various sampling processes within the model.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the model passed to this function has the appropriate sampling attributes initialized, particularly the `sigmas` array, to avoid runtime errors.

**Output Example**: An example of the possible return value of the function could be a tensor containing sigma values such as:
```

## FunctionDef normal_scheduler(model, steps, sgm, floor)
**normal_scheduler**: The function of normal_scheduler is to generate a sequence of sigma values based on the specified number of steps within a defined range.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· model: An object that contains the model's sampling methods and properties, specifically sigma_max and sigma_min.
· steps: An integer representing the number of steps for which sigma values are to be generated.
· sgm: A boolean flag indicating whether to use a specific sampling method (default is False).
· floor: A boolean flag that is not utilized in the current implementation (default is False).

**Code Description**: The normal_scheduler function is designed to create a list of sigma values that are evenly spaced between a maximum and minimum sigma value defined in the model. It first retrieves the maximum and minimum sigma values using the model's sampling methods. The function then calculates the corresponding timesteps for these sigma values. 

If the sgm parameter is set to True, the function generates timesteps that exclude the last value, resulting in one less timestep than the specified number of steps. Otherwise, it includes all timesteps. For each timestep, the function computes the corresponding sigma value using the model's sigma method and appends it to a list. Finally, it appends a zero value to the list of sigmas and returns the list as a PyTorch FloatTensor.

This function is called by other functions such as calculate_sigmas_scheduler and calculate_sigmas_scheduler_hacked. In these functions, normal_scheduler is invoked when the scheduler_name parameter is set to "normal" or "sgm_uniform". This indicates that normal_scheduler plays a crucial role in generating sigma values for different scheduling strategies, allowing for flexibility in how sigma values are computed based on the chosen scheduler.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the model passed to the function has the appropriate sampling methods defined, as the function relies on these methods to retrieve sigma_max and sigma_min values.

**Output Example**: An example output of the normal_scheduler function when called with a model and steps=5 might look like this: 
```
tensor([0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.0])
``` 
This output represents a sequence of sigma values generated based on the specified parameters.
## FunctionDef get_mask_aabb(masks)
**get_mask_aabb**: The function of get_mask_aabb is to compute the axis-aligned bounding boxes for a set of masks and determine which masks are empty.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· masks: A tensor of shape (b, h, w) representing a batch of binary masks, where 'b' is the number of masks, and 'h' and 'w' are the height and width of each mask.

**Code Description**: The get_mask_aabb function processes a batch of binary masks to calculate their bounding boxes. It first checks if the input tensor masks is empty; if so, it returns an empty tensor of shape (0, 4). For non-empty masks, it initializes a tensor bounding_boxes to store the bounding box coordinates and a boolean tensor is_empty to indicate whether each mask is empty.

The function iterates through each mask in the batch. For each mask, it checks if the mask contains any non-zero elements. If a mask is entirely zero, it marks it as empty in the is_empty tensor. If the mask contains non-zero elements, the function uses torch.where to find the coordinates of the non-zero pixels. It then calculates the minimum and maximum x and y coordinates to define the bounding box for that mask, storing these values in the bounding_boxes tensor.

The function ultimately returns two tensors: bounding_boxes, which contains the coordinates of the bounding boxes for each mask, and is_empty, which indicates whether each mask is empty.

This function is called by the resolve_areas_and_cond_masks function. In that context, it is used to determine the bounding boxes of masks that are being processed. Specifically, when the condition 'set_area_to_bounds' is true, the function retrieves the maximum bounds of the mask and uses get_mask_aabb to compute the bounding boxes. If the computed bounding box indicates that the mask is empty, a default area is set; otherwise, the area is adjusted based on the bounding box dimensions.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the input masks tensor is properly formatted and contains binary values (0s and 1s) for accurate bounding box calculations.

**Output Example**: For an input of masks with two binary masks, where the first mask has non-zero elements forming a rectangle and the second mask is empty, the output might look like:
- bounding_boxes: tensor([[1, 2, 4, 5], [0, 0, 0, 0]]) 
- is_empty: tensor([False, True])
## FunctionDef resolve_areas_and_cond_masks(conditions, h, w, device)
**resolve_areas_and_cond_masks**: The function of resolve_areas_and_cond_masks is to adjust the area and mask conditions for sampling based on specified parameters, ensuring that the areas are correctly defined and masks are appropriately processed for performance.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· conditions: A list of dictionaries, where each dictionary contains condition information, including optional 'area' and 'mask' keys.
· h: An integer representing the height of the area to be processed.
· w: An integer representing the width of the area to be processed.
· device: A string or device object indicating the device (e.g., CPU or GPU) on which the computations will be performed.

**Code Description**: The resolve_areas_and_cond_masks function iterates through a list of conditions to modify the 'area' and 'mask' attributes as necessary. 

1. For each condition in the list, if the 'area' key is present and its first element is "percentage", the function calculates the actual pixel dimensions based on the height (h) and width (w) provided. The area is then updated in the condition dictionary.

2. If the 'mask' key is present, the function processes the mask tensor:
   - It moves the mask to the specified device.
   - If the mask is 2-dimensional, it adds an additional dimension to make it compatible for further processing.
   - The function checks if the mask dimensions match the specified height and width. If they do not, it resizes the mask using bilinear interpolation to fit the specified dimensions.

3. If the condition has the 'set_area_to_bounds' key set to True, the function computes the bounding box of the mask using the get_mask_aabb function. This function determines the axis-aligned bounding boxes for the masks and checks if they are empty. If the mask is empty, a default area of (8, 8, 0, 0) is set. If the mask is not empty, the area is adjusted based on the bounding box dimensions.

4. Finally, the modified condition is updated in the list of conditions.

This function is called by the sample and sample_hacked functions, which are responsible for generating samples based on the model and conditions provided. In these contexts, resolve_areas_and_cond_masks ensures that the conditions are properly set up before the sampling process begins, allowing for efficient and accurate sampling based on the defined areas and masks.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the input conditions are correctly formatted and that the masks are binary tensors for accurate processing. Additionally, the device specified must be compatible with the tensors being processed to avoid runtime errors.
## FunctionDef create_cond_with_same_area_if_none(conds, c)
**create_cond_with_same_area_if_none**: The function of create_cond_with_same_area_if_none is to ensure that for each condition in a given list, there exists a corresponding condition with the same area.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· conds: A list of conditions that may or may not contain an 'area' key.
· c: A condition that must contain an 'area' key for the function to operate.

**Code Description**: The create_cond_with_same_area_if_none function begins by checking if the condition 'c' has an 'area' key. If 'c' does not have this key, the function returns immediately without making any changes. If 'c' has an 'area', the function retrieves this area and initializes a variable 'smallest' to None, which will be used to track the smallest condition that meets certain criteria.

The function then iterates over each condition in the 'conds' list. For each condition 'x', it checks if 'x' has an 'area' key. If it does, the function compares the dimensions of 'x' with those of 'c'. Specifically, it checks if the area of 'c' is greater than or equal to the area of 'x' in both width and height. If 'x' meets these criteria, the function further checks if 'x' is the smallest condition found so far based on the area size. If 'x' is smaller than the current 'smallest', it updates 'smallest' to 'x'.

If 'x' does not have an 'area' key, the function checks if 'smallest' is still None. If it is, it assigns 'x' to 'smallest'. After iterating through all conditions, if 'smallest' remains None, the function returns, indicating that no suitable condition was found.

If a suitable 'smallest' condition is found, the function checks if its area is equal to that of 'c'. If they are equal, it returns without making any changes. If they are not equal, the function creates a copy of condition 'c', adds the 'model_conds' from 'smallest', and appends this new condition to the 'conds' list.

This function is called within the sample and sample_hacked functions, where it ensures that for each condition in the positive and negative lists, there exists a corresponding condition in the opposite list with the same area. This is crucial for maintaining consistency in the model's input conditions, allowing for effective processing and generation of samples.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the conditions passed to this function contain the necessary 'area' key for it to function correctly. Additionally, the function modifies the 'conds' list in place, which may affect subsequent operations on this list.

**Output Example**: An example of the output could be a modified list of conditions where a new condition has been added to 'conds' that matches the area of 'c', ensuring that all conditions have corresponding pairs with the same area. For instance, if 'c' has an area of [0, 0, 100, 100], and the smallest condition found is [0, 0, 80, 80], the output would include a new condition that matches the area of 'c'.
## FunctionDef calculate_start_end_timesteps(model, conds)
**calculate_start_end_timesteps**: The function of calculate_start_end_timesteps is to compute and update the start and end timesteps based on percentage values provided in the conditions.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· model: An object representing the model used for sampling, which contains methods for processing sampling parameters.
· conds: A list of condition dictionaries, where each dictionary may contain 'start_percent' and 'end_percent' keys that specify the percentage values for calculating the corresponding timesteps.

**Code Description**: The calculate_start_end_timesteps function iterates through a list of condition dictionaries (conds) and computes the start and end timesteps based on percentage values. It utilizes the model's sampling methods to convert percentage values into sigma values, which are then stored back into the condition dictionaries.

The function begins by accessing the model's sampling methods through the attribute `model.model_sampling`. It then loops through each condition in the conds list. For each condition, it checks for the presence of 'start_percent' and 'end_percent'. If these keys are found, the function calls the method `percent_to_sigma` to convert the percentage values into corresponding sigma values, which represent the start and end timesteps.

If either timestep is computed (i.e., not None), the function creates a copy of the current condition dictionary and adds the computed timesteps as 'timestep_start' and 'timestep_end'. The original condition in the list is then updated with this new dictionary containing the computed values.

This function is called within two other functions: sample and sample_hacked. In both cases, it is invoked to process the negative and positive condition lists before further operations are performed. This ensures that the conditions are properly set up with the necessary timestep information before they are passed to subsequent processing steps, such as encoding model conditions and applying control mechanisms.

**Note**: It is essential to ensure that the condition dictionaries contain valid percentage values for the function to compute the timesteps accurately. If the keys 'start_percent' or 'end_percent' are missing, the corresponding timesteps will remain None.
## FunctionDef pre_run_control(model, conds)
**pre_run_control**: The function of pre_run_control is to prepare the model for sampling by executing any pre-run control logic defined in the conditions.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· model: An object representing the model that is being sampled.
· conds: A list of conditions that may include control instructions for the model.

**Code Description**: The pre_run_control function takes two parameters: a model and a list of conditions (conds). It begins by accessing the model's sampling functionality through the attribute `model_sampling`. The function then iterates over each condition in the conds list. For each condition, it checks if there is a 'control' key present. If this key exists, it invokes the `pre_run` method of the control object, passing the model and a lambda function that converts a percentage to a sigma value using the model's `percent_to_sigma` method.

This function is called within the sample and sample_hacked functions, which are responsible for generating samples from the model. In the sample function, pre_run_control is invoked with the combined list of negative and positive conditions, ensuring that any necessary pre-run logic is executed for both sets of conditions before proceeding with the sampling process. In the sample_hacked function, pre_run_control is called with only the positive conditions, indicating a specific optimization for that context.

The pre_run_control function is crucial for setting up the model's state based on the provided conditions, particularly when control mechanisms are involved. This ensures that the model behaves as expected during the sampling phase, adhering to any control logic defined in the conditions.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the conditions passed to pre_run_control are structured correctly and contain the necessary control keys to avoid runtime errors.
## FunctionDef apply_empty_x_to_equal_area(conds, uncond, name, uncond_fill_func)
**apply_empty_x_to_equal_area**: The function of apply_empty_x_to_equal_area is to fill in missing conditional values in an unconditioned dataset based on existing conditions while ensuring that the areas of the conditions are equal.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· conds: A list of conditional data points that may contain specific attributes.
· uncond: A list of unconditioned data points where missing values will be filled.
· name: A string representing the specific attribute name to be processed.
· uncond_fill_func: A function that defines how to fill in the missing values based on the conditional data.

**Code Description**: The apply_empty_x_to_equal_area function processes two lists: conds and uncond. It first initializes four lists to categorize the data: cond_cnets and cond_other for the conditional data, and uncond_cnets and uncond_other for the unconditioned data. The function iterates through the conds list, checking for the presence of the specified name and whether it is not None. If the conditions are met, the corresponding values are appended to cond_cnets; otherwise, the entire item and its index are stored in cond_other.

A similar process is applied to the uncond list. If uncond_cnets is empty after processing, the function returns early, indicating that there are no values to fill.

For each entry in cond_cnets, the function attempts to fill in the missing values in uncond using the uncond_fill_func. It selects an unconditioned item from uncond_other based on the current index modulo the length of uncond_other. If the selected unconditioned item contains the specified name and it is not None, a copy of that item is made with the missing value filled in. This new item is then appended to uncond. If the name is not present or is None, the original item in uncond is updated with the new value.

This function is called within the sample and sample_hacked functions, which are responsible for generating samples from a model. In these contexts, apply_empty_x_to_equal_area ensures that the generated samples have consistent attributes across both conditioned and unconditioned datasets, particularly focusing on maintaining equal areas for the conditions being processed. The function is crucial for preparing the data before it is passed to the sampling process, thereby enhancing the quality and coherence of the generated outputs.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the uncond_fill_func provided is capable of handling the conditional data correctly to avoid errors during the filling process.

**Output Example**: An example of the output after executing the function could be a modified uncond list where missing values for the specified name have been filled based on the logic defined in uncond_fill_func, resulting in a more complete dataset ready for further processing. For instance, if the input uncond was [{'control': None}, {'control': 'value2'}] and the filling logic provided a value of 'filled_value', the output could be [{'control': 'filled_value'}, {'control': 'value2'}].
## FunctionDef encode_model_conds(model_function, conds, noise, device, prompt_type)
**encode_model_conds**: The function of encode_model_conds is to process a list of conditions by applying a model function to each condition, updating them with the model's outputs and additional parameters.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· model_function: A callable function that processes the conditions and returns updated values.
· conds: A list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a condition to be processed.
· noise: A tensor representing noise data, which may be used in the processing of conditions.
· device: A string or object indicating the device (e.g., CPU or GPU) on which the computations should be performed.
· prompt_type: A string that specifies the type of prompt being processed (e.g., "positive" or "negative").
· kwargs: Additional keyword arguments that can be passed to the model_function.

**Code Description**: The encode_model_conds function iterates over a list of conditions (conds), where each condition is expected to be a dictionary. For each condition, it creates a copy and updates it with several parameters, including device, noise, width, height, and prompt_type. The width and height are set based on the dimensions of the noise tensor if they are not already specified in the condition. The function then merges any additional keyword arguments provided into the parameters for the model function.

The model_function is called with the updated parameters, and its output is used to update the 'model_conds' key in the condition dictionary. This process is repeated for each condition in the list, and the modified list of conditions is returned.

This function is called in multiple places within the project. For instance, in the cfg_function defined in ldm_patched/contrib/external_perpneg.py, encode_model_conds is used to process both positive and negative conditions before further calculations are performed. Similarly, in the sample function located in ldm_patched/modules/samplers.py, it is used to encode both positive and negative conditions, ensuring that they are appropriately prepared for the sampling process. The function's role is crucial in ensuring that the conditions are correctly formatted and contain the necessary information for subsequent processing steps.

**Note**: When using this function, ensure that the model_function is compatible with the expected parameters and that the conditions provided are structured correctly as dictionaries.

**Output Example**: An example of the return value from encode_model_conds could be a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary has been updated to include new model conditions, such as:
```python
[
    {'model_conds': {'output1': value1, 'output2': value2}, 'other_key': other_value},
    {'model_conds': {'output1': value3, 'output2': value4}, 'other_key': other_value2},
    ...
]
```
## ClassDef Sampler
**Sampler**: The function of Sampler is to provide a base class for sampling methods used in the model.

**attributes**: The attributes of this Class.
· None

**Code Description**: The Sampler class serves as a foundational class for various sampling strategies in the project. It includes two methods: `sample` and `max_denoise`. The `sample` method is defined but not implemented, indicating that subclasses inheriting from Sampler are expected to provide their own implementations for sampling functionality.

The `max_denoise` method takes two parameters, `model_wrap` and `sigmas`. It retrieves the maximum sigma value from the inner model of the `model_wrap` object and compares it to the first value in the `sigmas` list. The method returns a boolean indicating whether the provided sigma is close to or exceeds the maximum sigma, using a relative tolerance of 1e-05 for comparison. This functionality is crucial for determining the appropriateness of the noise level during the sampling process.

The Sampler class is inherited by several other classes in the project, including UNIPC, UNIPCBH2, and KSAMPLER. Each of these subclasses implements the `sample` method, utilizing the `max_denoise` method to assess the noise level before proceeding with their specific sampling logic. For instance, both UNIPC and UNIPCBH2 classes call the `max_denoise` method to determine the maximum allowable noise before executing their sampling processes. The KSAMPLER class also incorporates this method to adjust the noise based on the sigma values, ensuring that the sampling adheres to the defined noise constraints.

**Note**: It is important to implement the `sample` method in any subclass of Sampler to ensure proper functionality. Additionally, when using the `max_denoise` method, ensure that the `model_wrap` object is correctly initialized and contains the necessary attributes.

**Output Example**: The output of the `max_denoise` method could be a boolean value, such as `True` or `False`, indicating whether the provided sigma meets the noise criteria.
### FunctionDef sample(self)
**sample**: The function of sample is to define a method intended for sampling operations within the Sampler class.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· There are no parameters for this function.

**Code Description**: The sample function is currently defined but does not contain any implementation, as indicated by the use of the `pass` statement. This means that the function is a placeholder and does not perform any actions or return any values at this time. The absence of parameters suggests that this function is intended to operate without requiring any input from the caller. It is likely designed to be overridden or further developed in subclasses or future implementations of the Sampler class, where specific sampling logic can be defined.

**Note**: Since the sample function does not contain any executable code, it cannot be called to perform any operations in its current state. Developers should implement the necessary logic within this function to fulfill the intended sampling functionality when extending or modifying the Sampler class.
***
### FunctionDef max_denoise(self, model_wrap, sigmas)
**max_denoise**: The function of max_denoise is to determine if a given sigma value is close to or exceeds the maximum allowed sigma value defined in the model.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· model_wrap: An object that wraps the model and provides access to its properties, including the maximum sigma value.
· sigmas: A list or array of sigma values, from which the first value is used for the comparison.

**Code Description**: The max_denoise function takes two parameters: model_wrap and sigmas. It retrieves the maximum sigma value (max_sigma) from the inner model of the model_wrap object. The first value from the sigmas parameter is then converted to a float and assigned to the variable sigma. The function checks if sigma is approximately equal to max_sigma within a relative tolerance of 1e-05 using the math.isclose function. Additionally, it checks if sigma is greater than max_sigma. The function returns True if either condition is satisfied, indicating that the denoising process can proceed with the given sigma value; otherwise, it returns False.

This function is called by several sampling methods within the project, specifically in the sample methods of the UNIPC, UNIPCBH2, and KSampler classes. In these contexts, max_denoise is used to determine how to adjust the noise based on the sigma values provided. For instance, in the KSampler's sample method, if max_denoise returns True, the noise is adjusted by multiplying it with the square root of (1.0 + sigmas[0] ** 2.0). If it returns False, the noise is simply multiplied by sigmas[0]. This conditional adjustment is crucial for ensuring that the noise level is appropriate for the sampling process, thereby affecting the quality of the generated samples.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the sigmas parameter contains valid numerical values, as the function relies on the first element for its calculations. 

**Output Example**: A possible return value of the function could be True or False, depending on the comparison between the max_sigma and the provided sigma value. For example, if max_sigma is 1.0 and sigma is 1.0, the function would return True. If sigma were 0.5, it would return False.

This method takes several parameters, including `model_wrap`, `sigmas`, `extra_args`, `callback`, `noise`, `latent_image`, `denoise_mask`, and `disable_pbar`.

Within the `sample` method, the `uni_pc.sample_unipc` function is called, passing along the necessary parameters. Notably, the method utilizes the `max_denoise` method from the Sampler class to determine the maximum allowable noise based on the provided `sigmas`. This ensures that the sampling process adheres to the noise constraints defined by the model.

The UNIPC class is instantiated through the `sampler_object` function, which checks the name provided and creates an instance of UNIPC when the name "uni_pc" is specified. This function serves as a factory for creating different sampler objects, allowing for easy selection of the desired sampling strategy.

**Note**: When using the UNIPC class, it is essential to ensure that the `model_wrap` object is properly initialized and contains the necessary attributes for sampling. Additionally, the parameters passed to the `sample` method should be carefully considered to achieve the desired sampling results.

**Output Example**: The output of the `sample` method could be a processed image or a tensor representing the sampled output, depending on the implementation of the `uni_pc.sample_unipc` function. For instance, it might return a tensor of shape (batch_size, channels, height, width) representing the generated samples.
### FunctionDef sample(self, model_wrap, sigmas, extra_args, callback, noise, latent_image, denoise_mask, disable_pbar)

**Code Description**: The sample function orchestrates the sampling and denoising process by calling the sample_unipc function from the uni_pc module. It takes several parameters, including a model wrapper, noise tensor, and sigma values, to facilitate the denoising of images based on a diffusion model.

Initially, the function invokes the max_denoise method to determine the maximum denoising capability based on the provided model and sigma values. This method checks if the first sigma value is close to or exceeds the maximum allowed sigma value defined in the model. The result of this check influences the sampling process.

The core of the sampling operation is handled by the sample_unipc function. This function takes the model wrapper, noise tensor, optional latent image, sigma values, and other parameters to perform the actual sampling and denoising. It utilizes a unified predictor-corrector framework to iteratively refine the image based on the model's predictions and the specified noise levels.

The sample function is designed to be called by other components within the project that require image sampling and denoising capabilities. It serves as an interface that abstracts the complexity of the underlying sampling process, allowing users to easily specify the necessary parameters and receive a denoised image as output.

**Note**: Users should ensure that the input parameters, particularly the model wrapper and noise tensors, are correctly specified to avoid runtime errors. Additionally, the optional parameters such as latent_image and denoise_mask can be utilized to customize the sampling process further.

**Output Example**: A possible output of the sample function could be a tensor representing the denoised image, which may look like:
```
tensor([[0.6, 0.4, 0.8],
        [0.2, 0.5, 0.7]])
```
The actual output will depend on the input image, noise, and the internal state of the model during execution.
***
## ClassDef UNIPCBH2
**UNIPCBH2**: The function of UNIPCBH2 is to implement a specific sampling method for the model using the uni_pc sampling strategy with the 'bh2' variant.

**attributes**: The attributes of this Class.
· None

**Code Description**: The UNIPCBH2 class inherits from the Sampler class, which serves as a base for various sampling strategies within the project. The primary functionality of UNIPCBH2 is encapsulated in the `sample` method, which is responsible for executing the sampling process.

This function is provided with several arguments, including the `model_wrap`, `noise`, `latent_image`, `sigmas`, and others. Notably, the `max_denoise` method from the Sampler class is invoked to determine the maximum allowable noise based on the provided `sigmas`. This ensures that the sampling adheres to the defined noise constraints.

The UNIPCBH2 class is instantiated through the `sampler_object` function, which checks the name provided and creates an instance of UNIPCBH2 when the name "uni_pc_bh2" is passed. This function serves as a factory for creating different sampler objects based on the specified name, allowing for flexible sampling strategies within the project.

**Note**: When using the UNIPCBH2 class, ensure that the `model_wrap` object is properly initialized and contains the necessary attributes for the sampling process. Additionally, be mindful of the parameters passed to the `sample` method, as they directly influence the behavior and output of the sampling operation.

**Output Example**: The output of the `sample` method could be a processed image or a tensor representing the sampled output, depending on the implementation of the `uni_pc.sample_unipc` function.

· disable_pbar: A boolean indicating whether to disable the progress bar during execution.

**Code Description**: The sample function orchestrates the sampling and denoising process by invoking the sample_unipc function from the uni_pc module. It begins by passing the necessary parameters to sample_unipc, including the model_wrap, noise tensor, latent_image, and sigmas. The function also computes the maximum denoising level by calling the max_denoise method, which checks if the provided sigma values exceed the maximum allowed sigma defined in the model.

The sample_unipc function is responsible for executing the core sampling and denoising logic. It utilizes the diffusion model to predict noise and adjust the input image based on the specified noise levels (sigmas). The function handles the initialization of the sampling process, including the creation of a UniPC instance that implements the unified predictor-corrector algorithm. This instance is then used to iteratively update the input image based on the model's predictions and the specified timesteps.

The sample function is a crucial part of the sampling workflow, as it connects the model wrapper and the noise input to the sampling process, ensuring that the generated images are denoised appropriately. It is designed to be called by higher-level sampling methods within the project, facilitating the integration of various sampling strategies.

**Note**: Users should ensure that the input parameters, particularly the model_wrap and noise tensors, are correctly specified to avoid runtime errors. Additionally, the disable_pbar parameter can be used to control the visibility of the progress bar during execution, which may be useful in different user interface contexts.

**Output Example**: A possible output of the sample function could be a tensor representing the denoised image, which may look like:
```
tensor([[0.5, 0.3, 0.7],
        [0.1, 0.4, 0.6]])
```
The actual output will depend on the input image, noise, and the internal state of the model during execution.

## ClassDef KSAMPLER
**KSAMPLER**: The function of KSAMPLER is to implement a specific sampling strategy using a provided sampler function along with additional options for inpainting and extra configurations.

**attributes**: The attributes of this Class.
· sampler_function: A callable function that defines the sampling method to be used.
· extra_options: A dictionary containing additional options for the sampling process.
· inpaint_options: A dictionary containing options specific to inpainting functionality.

**Code Description**: The KSAMPLER class inherits from the Sampler base class and is designed to facilitate the sampling process in a model by utilizing a specified sampling function. Upon initialization, it accepts three parameters: `sampler_function`, `extra_options`, and `inpaint_options`. The `sampler_function` is crucial as it determines the actual sampling logic that will be executed. The `extra_options` and `inpaint_options` allow for further customization of the sampling behavior.

The primary method of the KSAMPLER class is `sample`, which orchestrates the sampling process. This method takes several parameters, including `model_wrap`, `sigmas`, `extra_args`, `callback`, `noise`, `latent_image`, `denoise_mask`, and `disable_pbar`. Within this method, the `denoise_mask` is added to the `extra_args`, and an instance of `KSamplerX0Inpaint` is created using the provided `model_wrap`. The `latent_image` is assigned to the `model_k` instance, which is essential for the inpainting process.

The method checks the `inpaint_options` to determine if random noise should be generated. If the `random` option is set to `True`, a new noise tensor is created using a manual seed derived from the provided `extra_args`. If not, the existing `noise` tensor is used. The method then adjusts the noise based on the maximum denoising capability of the model, as determined by the `max_denoise` method inherited from the Sampler class.

A callback function is defined if a callback is provided, allowing for progress tracking during the sampling process. The `latent_image` is added to the noise if it is not `None`, ensuring that the sampling incorporates any existing latent information.

Finally, the method calls the `sampler_function` with the prepared parameters and returns the generated samples. This design allows for flexibility in sampling strategies, as different functions can be passed to the KSAMPLER, enabling various sampling techniques to be employed seamlessly.

The KSAMPLER class is instantiated through the `ksampler` function, which selects the appropriate sampling function based on the `sampler_name` provided. This function serves as a factory for creating KSAMPLER instances, allowing users to specify different sampling methods such as "dpm_fast" or "dpm_adaptive".

**Note**: When using the KSAMPLER class, ensure that the `sampler_function` is compatible with the expected parameters. Additionally, verify that the `model_wrap` object is properly initialized and contains the necessary attributes for the sampling process to function correctly.

**Output Example**: The output of the `sample` method could be a tensor representing the generated samples, such as `tensor([[0.1, 0.2], [0.3, 0.4]])`, indicating the sampled values from the model.
### FunctionDef __init__(self, sampler_function, extra_options, inpaint_options)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize an instance of the class with specific sampling functions and options.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· sampler_function: A callable function that defines the sampling behavior for the instance.  
· extra_options: A dictionary containing additional options that may modify the behavior of the sampler. Defaults to an empty dictionary.  
· inpaint_options: A dictionary that holds options specifically for inpainting processes. Defaults to an empty dictionary.  

**Code Description**: The __init__ function is a constructor for the class, which is responsible for creating an instance of the class with the provided parameters. It takes three arguments: `sampler_function`, `extra_options`, and `inpaint_options`. The `sampler_function` parameter is expected to be a callable that will be used for sampling operations within the class. The `extra_options` parameter allows users to pass in a set of additional configurations that can influence how the sampling is performed. This is particularly useful for customizing the behavior of the sampler based on specific requirements. The `inpaint_options` parameter is dedicated to settings related to inpainting, which is a technique used to fill in missing or corrupted parts of data. By default, both `extra_options` and `inpaint_options` are initialized as empty dictionaries, allowing for flexibility in the initialization process.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the `sampler_function` provided is compatible with the expected input and output of the class to avoid runtime errors. Additionally, users should be aware that the contents of `extra_options` and `inpaint_options` can significantly affect the functionality of the sampler, so they should be defined carefully based on the intended use case.

### FunctionDef sample(self, model_wrap, sigmas, extra_args, callback, noise, latent_image, denoise_mask, disable_pbar)
**sample**: The function of sample is to generate samples from a model using specified noise and sigma values, while optionally applying inpainting and denoising techniques.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· model_wrap: An object that wraps the model used for sampling, providing access to its properties and methods.
· sigmas: A list or array of sigma values that control the noise levels during sampling.
· extra_args: A dictionary containing additional arguments for the sampling process, including a denoise mask.
· callback: An optional function that is called during the sampling process to provide updates.
· noise: A tensor representing the initial noise to be applied during sampling.
· latent_image: An optional tensor that represents the latent image to be blended with the noise.
· denoise_mask: An optional tensor that specifies areas to be denoised during the sampling process.
· disable_pbar: A boolean flag indicating whether to disable the progress bar during sampling.

**Code Description**: The sample function is designed to facilitate the generation of samples from a model while incorporating various parameters that influence the sampling process. It begins by updating the extra_args dictionary with the provided denoise_mask. An instance of KSamplerX0Inpaint is created using the model_wrap, which allows for inpainting operations during sampling. The latent_image attribute of the model_k instance is set to the provided latent_image.

The function then checks if random inpainting is enabled through the inpaint_options attribute. If so, it initializes a random noise tensor using a manual seed derived from the extra_args. If random inpainting is not enabled, the function uses the provided noise tensor directly.

Next, the function evaluates whether the maximum denoising condition is met by calling the max_denoise method. Depending on the result, it adjusts the noise tensor accordingly. If the maximum denoising condition is satisfied, the noise is scaled by the square root of (1.0 + sigmas[0] ** 2.0). Otherwise, it is scaled by sigmas[0].

A callback function is prepared if one is provided, which will be invoked during the sampling process to report progress. If a latent_image is provided, it is added to the noise tensor to create a composite input for the sampling operation.

Finally, the function calls the sampler_function method of the KSampler class, passing in the model_k instance, the adjusted noise, the sigma values, and any additional options. The result of this operation is returned as samples, which represent the generated outputs based on the specified parameters.

This function plays a crucial role in the sampling workflow, integrating inpainting capabilities and allowing for dynamic adjustments based on the provided parameters. It effectively combines noise, latent images, and denoising masks to produce high-quality samples from the model.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the noise and latent_image tensors are appropriately defined and compatible with the model's requirements. Additionally, the denoise_mask should be carefully constructed to achieve the desired inpainting effect.

**Output Example**: A possible return value from the sample function could be a tensor representing the generated samples, which may look like a batch of images with specific areas modified according to the denoise mask and blended with the latent image and noise as specified.
***
## FunctionDef ksampler(sampler_name, extra_options, inpaint_options)
**ksampler**: The function of ksampler is to create an instance of the KSAMPLER class with a specified sampling function based on the provided sampler name and options.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· sampler_name: A string that specifies the name of the sampling method to be used (e.g., "dpm_fast", "dpm_adaptive").
· extra_options: A dictionary containing additional options for the sampling process (default is an empty dictionary).
· inpaint_options: A dictionary containing options specific to inpainting functionality (default is an empty dictionary).

**Code Description**: The ksampler function serves as a factory for creating instances of the KSAMPLER class, which is designed to facilitate the sampling process in a model by utilizing a specified sampling function. The function first checks the value of the `sampler_name` parameter to determine which sampling function to use.

If the `sampler_name` is "dpm_fast", a nested function `dpm_fast_function` is defined, which implements the DPM fast sampling method. This function calculates the minimum sigma value and the total number of steps before calling the `sample_dpm_fast` method from the `k_diffusion_sampling` module.

If the `sampler_name` is "dpm_adaptive", a similar nested function `dpm_adaptive_function` is defined for the DPM adaptive sampling method, following the same logic as the previous case but calling the `sample_dpm_adaptive` method instead.

For any other `sampler_name`, the function dynamically retrieves the corresponding sampling function from the `k_diffusion_sampling` module using the `getattr` function, allowing for flexibility in specifying different sampling methods.

Once the appropriate sampling function is determined, the ksampler function returns an instance of the KSAMPLER class, initialized with the selected `sampler_function`, along with the provided `extra_options` and `inpaint_options`. This design allows users to easily create different sampling strategies by simply specifying the desired sampler name and options.

The ksampler function is called by various other functions within the project, such as `get_sampler` methods in different sampler classes (e.g., SamplerDPMPP_2M_SDE, SamplerDPMPP_SDE, and SamplerTCD). Each of these functions uses ksampler to obtain a configured sampler instance tailored to specific requirements, such as noise handling and solver types.

**Note**: When using the ksampler function, ensure that the specified `sampler_name` corresponds to a valid sampling method available in the `k_diffusion_sampling` module. Additionally, verify that the `extra_options` and `inpaint_options` dictionaries contain the necessary parameters for the intended sampling process.

**Output Example**: The output of the ksampler function could be an instance of the KSAMPLER class, such as `KSAMPLER(sampler_function=<function dpm_fast_function>, extra_options={'eta': 0.5}, inpaint_options={})`, indicating the configured sampler ready for use in the sampling process.
### FunctionDef dpm_fast_function(model, noise, sigmas, extra_args, callback, disable)
**dpm_fast_function**: The function of dpm_fast_function is to facilitate fast sampling using a Denoising Probabilistic Model (DPM) solver by preparing the necessary parameters and invoking the sample_dpm_fast function.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· model: The neural network model utilized for generating predictions during the denoising process.  
· noise: A tensor representing the initial state or input that will be updated during the denoising process.  
· sigmas: An array of float values representing the noise levels at various steps in the diffusion process.  
· extra_args: An optional dictionary for any additional arguments that may be required by the model.  
· callback: An optional function that is called to provide information during the sampling process.  
· disable: A boolean flag to disable the progress bar during execution.  

**Code Description**: The dpm_fast_function is designed to streamline the process of fast sampling by first determining the minimum sigma value from the provided sigmas array. It checks if the last value in the sigmas array is zero; if so, it assigns the second-to-last value as the new minimum sigma. The function then calculates the total number of steps by subtracting one from the length of the sigmas array. 

Subsequently, dpm_fast_function calls the sample_dpm_fast function from the k_diffusion_sampling module, passing along the model, noise, the determined minimum sigma, the first value in the sigmas array (which represents the maximum noise level), the total number of steps, and any additional arguments, callback function, and disable flag. 

This function acts as a preparatory layer that ensures the parameters are correctly set before invoking the more complex sampling process handled by sample_dpm_fast. It encapsulates the logic required to derive the necessary inputs for the sampling function, thereby simplifying the interface for users who wish to perform fast sampling with a DPM solver.

**Note**: It is essential to ensure that the sigmas array is properly defined and contains valid values representing the noise levels. Additionally, the model and noise parameters must be appropriately configured to ensure successful execution of the sampling process.

**Output Example**: An example output of the function could be:
```python
denoised_output = dpm_fast_function(model, initial_noise, sigma_values, extra_args=extra_args, callback=callback_function, disable=False)
# This might return a tensor representing the denoised state after processing.
```
***
### FunctionDef dpm_adaptive_function(model, noise, sigmas, extra_args, callback, disable)
**dpm_adaptive_function**: The function of dpm_adaptive_function is to facilitate adaptive sampling in a diffusion model using a DPM solver.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· model: A neural network model used for generating predictions during the denoising process.  
· noise: A tensor representing the initial input state for the sampling process.  
· sigmas: A list of float values indicating the noise levels for the diffusion process, where the last element represents the minimum noise level.  
· extra_args: A dictionary for any additional arguments that may be required by the model (default is None).  
· callback: A callable function for providing updates during the sampling process (default is None).  
· disable: A boolean flag to disable progress tracking (default is None).  

**Code Description**: The dpm_adaptive_function is designed to streamline the process of adaptive sampling in diffusion models. It begins by extracting the minimum noise level from the provided sigmas list. If the minimum noise level is zero, it assigns the second-to-last value in the list to sigma_min to ensure that a valid noise level is used. This is crucial as the adaptive sampling process requires a non-zero minimum noise level to function correctly.

The function then calls the sample_dpm_adaptive function from the k_diffusion_sampling module, passing the model, noise, sigma_min, the first element of sigmas as sigma_max, and any additional arguments such as extra_args, callback, and disable. The sample_dpm_adaptive function is responsible for executing the actual adaptive sampling process, leveraging the capabilities of the Denoising Probabilistic Model (DPM) solver to manage the complexities of the denoising task.

The dpm_adaptive_function serves as a wrapper that simplifies the interaction with the underlying sampling mechanism, ensuring that the necessary parameters are correctly extracted and passed to the sample_dpm_adaptive function. This design promotes modularity and reusability within the codebase, allowing developers to easily implement adaptive sampling in their applications.

**Note**: It is essential to ensure that the model provided is compatible with the expected input dimensions and that the sigmas list contains valid noise levels. The function assumes that the last element of sigmas is the minimum noise level, and if it is zero, it will use the second-to-last value instead.

**Output Example**: A possible output of the function could be:
```python
denoised_output = dpm_adaptive_function(model, initial_noise, [1.0, 0.5, 0.0], extra_args, callback_function, disable_progress)
# denoised_output might be a tensor representing the final state after adaptive sampling.
```

**wrap_model**: The function of wrap_model is to create a noise prediction model wrapper using the CFGNoisePredictor class.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· model: An instance of a model that will be wrapped for noise prediction tasks.

**Code Description**: The wrap_model function takes a model as an input parameter and initializes an instance of the CFGNoisePredictor class with this model. The CFGNoisePredictor class is designed to serve as a wrapper around a noise prediction model, facilitating its application during the sampling process. By calling wrap_model, developers can easily prepare their models for noise prediction tasks, ensuring that they are encapsulated within the CFGNoisePredictor framework.

The wrap_model function is called by other functions in the project, such as sample and sample_hacked. In these functions, the model is first wrapped using wrap_model, resulting in a model_wrap variable that represents the wrapped model. This wrapped model is then passed to a sampler for generating samples, allowing the noise prediction capabilities of the original model to be utilized effectively.

The relationship between wrap_model and its callers is crucial for the overall functionality of the sampling process. By wrapping the model, it ensures that the model adheres to the expected interface and behavior required for noise prediction, thus enhancing the modularity and reusability of the code.

**Note**: When using the wrap_model function, ensure that the model passed to it is compatible with the expected input and output formats for noise prediction tasks. This compatibility is essential for the proper functioning of the CFGNoisePredictor and the subsequent sampling processes.

**Output Example**: The return value of the wrap_model function is an instance of CFGNoisePredictor, which encapsulates the provided model. This instance can then be used in the sampling process to predict noise, returning outputs that are shaped according to the model's architecture and input dimensions. For example, if the input model processes images, the output might be a tensor representing the predicted noise for each pixel in the input images.
## FunctionDef sample(model, noise, positive, negative, cfg, device, sampler, sigmas, model_options, latent_image, denoise_mask, callback, disable_pbar, seed)

**Code Description**: The sample function orchestrates the sampling process by first preparing the positive and negative conditions. It ensures that the areas and masks for these conditions are resolved using the resolve_areas_and_cond_masks function, which adjusts the conditions based on the noise dimensions and device specifications. The model is then wrapped using the wrap_model function, allowing it to be utilized effectively during sampling.

The function calculates the start and end timesteps for both positive and negative conditions using calculate_start_end_timesteps, ensuring that the conditions are set up correctly for the sampling process. If a latent image is provided, it is processed through the model to prepare it for sampling.

The function also encodes the model conditions for both positive and negative inputs using encode_model_conds, which applies the model function to each condition and updates them accordingly. It ensures that each condition in the positive list has a corresponding condition in the negative list with the same area by invoking create_cond_with_same_area_if_none.

Before running the sampling, pre_run_control is called to execute any necessary pre-run logic defined in the conditions. The function then applies empty values to equal areas in both positive and negative conditions using apply_empty_x_to_equal_area, ensuring consistency in the data.

Finally, the sampler is invoked to generate samples based on the wrapped model, sigma values, and the prepared conditions. The resulting samples are processed through the model to ensure they are in the correct format before being returned.

The sample function is called by other functions in the project, such as sample_custom and ksampler, which handle specific sampling scenarios. These functions prepare the necessary inputs and invoke sample to generate the required outputs, demonstrating its integral role in the sampling workflow.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that all input conditions are correctly formatted and that the model, noise, and other parameters are compatible to avoid runtime errors during the sampling process.

**Output Example**: An example of the return value from the sample function could be a tensor representing the generated samples, structured as follows:

1. If scheduler_name is "karras", it calls the get_sigmas_karras function, which constructs a noise schedule based on the Karras et al. (2022) methodology.
2. If scheduler_name is "exponential", it invokes the get_sigmas_exponential function to create an exponential noise schedule.
3. If scheduler_name is "normal", it utilizes the normal_scheduler function to generate sigma values evenly spaced between the model's defined maximum and minimum sigma values.
4. If scheduler_name is "simple", it calls the simple_scheduler function to produce a sequence of sigma values that are evenly spaced based on the total number of steps.
5. If scheduler_name is "ddim_uniform", it invokes the ddim_scheduler function to generate sigma values specifically for the DDIM (Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models) scheduler.
6. If scheduler_name is "sgm_uniform", it calls the normal_scheduler function with the sgm flag set to True, indicating a specific sampling method.

If an invalid scheduler_name is provided, the function prints an error message indicating the invalid input. The generated sigma values are then returned as a tensor.

The calculate_sigmas_scheduler function is called by various other functions within the project, including the get_sigmas method in the BasicScheduler class and the calculate_sigmas method in the KSampler class. These calling functions utilize calculate_sigmas_scheduler to obtain the necessary sigma values for different scheduling strategies, indicating its integral role in the broader context of noise scheduling and sampling processes.

**Note**: It is essential to ensure that the model passed to the function has the appropriate sampling attributes initialized, particularly the sigma_min and sigma_max values, to avoid runtime errors. Additionally, the scheduler_name must be one of the supported values to ensure correct functionality.

**Code Description**: The KSampler class is designed to manage the sampling process in a generative model. It initializes with a model, the number of steps for sampling, the device to run on, and optional parameters for the sampler and scheduler. The class maintains a list of available schedulers and samplers, ensuring that the selected options are valid. 

Upon initialization, if the provided scheduler or sampler is not in the predefined lists, it defaults to the first available option. The set_steps method calculates the appropriate noise levels (sigmas) based on the number of steps and the denoising parameter. The calculate_sigmas method handles specific cases for certain samplers that require adjustments to the number of steps.

The sample method is the core function that performs the actual sampling. It takes various inputs, including noise, conditioning data (positive and negative), and optional parameters for controlling the sampling process. If no sigmas are provided, it uses the pre-calculated sigmas. The method also allows for starting and ending the sampling at specific steps, and it can handle denoising masks and callbacks for progress tracking.

KSampler is called by other components in the project, such as the sample function in the ldm_patched/modules/sample.py module. This function prepares the model and inputs for sampling, creates an instance of KSampler, and invokes its sample method to generate the final output. The integration with other components ensures that KSampler operates within the broader context of the generative modeling framework.

**Note**: When using KSampler, it is important to ensure that the model and conditioning inputs are compatible with the selected sampler and scheduler. Proper management of the steps and denoising parameters is crucial for achieving the desired sampling results.

**Output Example**: A possible appearance of the code's return value could be a tensor representing the generated samples, which may look like a multi-dimensional array of floating-point values corresponding to the generated images or data points.
### FunctionDef __init__(self, model, steps, device, sampler, scheduler, denoise, model_options)

· model_options: A dictionary containing additional options for configuring the model.

**Code Description**: The __init__ method is a constructor for the KSampler class, responsible for setting up the initial state of an instance. It takes several parameters that define the behavior of the sampler. The method begins by assigning the provided model and device to instance variables. It then checks if the provided scheduler is valid by comparing it against a predefined list of schedulers (self.SCHEDULERS). If the scheduler is not found in this list, it defaults to the first scheduler. Similarly, it checks the sampler against a list of available samplers (self.SAMPLERS) and defaults to the first sampler if the provided one is invalid.

Next, the method calls the set_steps function, passing the steps and denoise parameters. This function is crucial for configuring the number of sampling steps and calculating the corresponding sigma values based on the denoise parameter. The denoise value influences how the sigma values are computed, which is essential for the sampling process.

Finally, the method assigns the denoise parameter and model options to their respective instance variables. This initialization ensures that the KSampler instance is fully configured and ready for use immediately after creation.

The proper initialization of the model, scheduler, and sampler is vital for the KSampler class to function correctly. Any discrepancies in these parameters can lead to runtime errors or unexpected behavior during the sampling process.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the denoise parameter is set appropriately, as it influences the number of steps used for sigma calculation. Additionally, the sampler and scheduler types must be correctly configured in the KSampler instance to avoid any discrepancies in the sampling process. Proper initialization of the model and device is also necessary to prevent runtime errors during the execution of the KSampler methods.

### FunctionDef calculate_sigmas(self, steps)
**calculate_sigmas**: The function of calculate_sigmas is to compute a sequence of sigma values based on the specified number of steps, adjusting for certain sampling methods.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· steps: An integer representing the number of steps for which sigma values are to be calculated.

**Code Description**: The calculate_sigmas method is a member function of the KSampler class, responsible for generating a tensor of sigma values used in the sampling process. The method begins by initializing a variable `sigmas` to None and a boolean flag `discard_penultimate_sigma` to False. 

The method checks the type of sampler being used by examining the `self.sampler` attribute. If the sampler is one of the specified types ('dpm_2', 'dpm_2_ancestral', 'uni_pc', 'uni_pc_bh2'), it increments the `steps` by 1 and sets the `discard_penultimate_sigma` flag to True. This adjustment is made to accommodate the specific requirements of these sampling methods, which necessitate an additional sigma value.

Next, the method calls the `calculate_sigmas_scheduler` function, passing the model, scheduler, and the adjusted number of steps. This function is responsible for generating the actual sigma values based on the scheduling method defined in the model. 

If the `discard_penultimate_sigma` flag is True, the method modifies the resulting `sigmas` tensor by concatenating all but the last two sigma values with the last sigma value. This effectively discards the penultimate sigma value, which is a requirement for certain samplers.

The method then returns the computed `sigmas` tensor, which contains the sigma values that will be used in the sampling process.

The calculate_sigmas method is called by the set_steps method within the same KSampler class. In set_steps, if the denoise parameter is not provided or is greater than 0.9999, it directly calculates the sigmas for the given steps. If denoise is provided and less than or equal to 0.9999, it calculates the sigmas for a reduced number of steps based on the denoise value and then selects the last few sigma values to ensure the correct number of steps is maintained.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the sampler type is correctly set in the KSampler instance, as this affects the calculation of sigma values. Additionally, the model and scheduler must be properly initialized to avoid runtime errors during the sigma calculation.

**Output Example**: An example output of the calculate_sigmas function when called with steps=5 might look like this:
```
tensor([0.0000, 0.1000, 0.3000, 0.6000, 1.0000])
```
This output represents a tensor of sigma values generated for the specified steps, with the last value being the maximum sigma value.

### FunctionDef set_steps(self, steps, denoise)
**set_steps**: The function of set_steps is to set the number of sampling steps and calculate the corresponding sigma values based on the provided denoise parameter.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· steps: An integer representing the number of steps to be set for the sampling process.
· denoise: A float that determines the level of denoising; if not provided or greater than 0.9999, the full number of steps is used for sigma calculation.

**Code Description**: The set_steps method is a member function of the KSampler class, which is responsible for configuring the sampling process by defining the number of steps and calculating the associated sigma values. When set_steps is called, it first assigns the provided steps to the instance variable `self.steps`. 

If the denoise parameter is not specified or is greater than 0.9999, the method calls the calculate_sigmas function with the specified number of steps. This function computes a tensor of sigma values that are essential for the sampling process, and the resulting values are stored in `self.sigmas`. 

In cases where the denoise parameter is provided and is less than or equal to 0.9999, the method calculates a new number of steps by dividing the original steps by the denoise value. It then calls calculate_sigmas with this new step count to generate the sigma values. After obtaining the sigma values, it selects the last few values from the computed tensor to ensure that the total number of steps remains consistent with the original input.

The set_steps method is invoked during the initialization of the KSampler class, specifically within the __init__ method. This ensures that the sampling configuration is established as soon as an instance of KSampler is created, allowing for immediate readiness for the sampling process.

The calculate_sigmas method, which is called within set_steps, is responsible for generating the sigma values based on the number of steps provided. It takes into account the type of sampler being used, which can affect the calculation of sigma values. The correct initialization of the model and scheduler is crucial for the successful execution of both set_steps and calculate_sigmas.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the denoise parameter is set appropriately, as it influences the number of steps used for sigma calculation. Additionally, the sampler type must be correctly configured in the KSampler instance to avoid any discrepancies in the sigma values generated. Proper initialization of the model and scheduler is also necessary to prevent runtime errors during the sigma calculation process.

### FunctionDef sample(self, noise, positive, negative, cfg, latent_image, start_step, last_step, force_full_denoise, denoise_mask, sigmas, callback, disable_pbar, seed)
**sample**: The function of sample is to perform the sampling process using a specified noise input along with positive and negative conditioning inputs, while allowing for various configurations and options.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· noise: A tensor representing the noise input to the sampling process.
· positive: A tensor representing the positive conditioning input.
· negative: A tensor representing the negative conditioning input.
· cfg: A configuration object that contains settings for the sampling process.
· latent_image: An optional tensor representing the latent image to be used; defaults to None.
· start_step: An optional integer indicating the starting step for the sampling process; defaults to None.
· last_step: An optional integer indicating the last step for the sampling process; defaults to None.
· force_full_denoise: A boolean flag that, when set to True, forces full denoising at the last step; defaults to False.
· denoise_mask: An optional tensor used to specify areas to denoise; defaults to None.
· sigmas: An optional list of sigma values for the sampling process; defaults to None.
· callback: An optional function to be called during the sampling process; defaults to None.
· disable_pbar: A boolean flag that, when set to True, disables the progress bar during sampling; defaults to False.
· seed: An optional integer used for random seed initialization; defaults to None.

**Code Description**: The sample function is responsible for executing the sampling process based on the provided inputs and configurations. Initially, it checks if the sigmas parameter is None; if so, it assigns the instance's sigmas attribute to sigmas. The function then evaluates the last_step parameter to determine if it should truncate the sigmas list. If last_step is specified and is less than the length of sigmas minus one, it slices the sigmas list accordingly. If force_full_denoise is True, it sets the last sigma value to zero, ensuring complete denoising at that step.

Next, the function checks the start_step parameter. If start_step is provided and is less than the length of sigmas minus one, it slices the sigmas list to start from the specified step. If start_step is greater than or equal to the length of sigmas minus one and a latent_image is provided, it returns the latent_image directly. If no latent_image is provided, it returns a tensor of zeros with the same shape as the noise input.

The function then creates a sampler instance by calling the sampler_object function with the instance's sampler attribute. This sampler instance is used to facilitate the sampling process.

Finally, the function calls the sample function (presumably defined elsewhere) with the model, noise, positive, negative, cfg, device, sampler, sigmas, model_options, and any additional parameters such as latent_image, denoise_mask, callback, disable_pbar, and seed. This call executes the actual sampling operation, returning the result of the sampling process.

The sample function is closely related to the sampler_object function, which is responsible for creating the appropriate sampler instance based on the specified name. This relationship ensures that the correct sampling strategy is employed during the sampling process.

**Note**: When using the sample function, it is important to ensure that the input tensors (noise, positive, negative) are correctly shaped and that the configuration object (cfg) contains valid settings for the sampling process. Additionally, users should be aware of the implications of the start_step and last_step parameters on the sampling behavior.

**Output Example**: The output of the sample function could be a tensor representing the sampled output, such as `tensor([[0.1, 0.2], [0.3, 0.4]])`, which reflects the results of the sampling process based on the provided inputs and configurations.
