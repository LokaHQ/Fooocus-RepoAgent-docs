## ClassDef VRAMState
**VRAMState**: The function of VRAMState is to represent the various states of VRAM availability for model management in a GPU environment.

**attributes**: The attributes of this Class.
· DISABLED: Indicates that no VRAM is present, and there is no need to move models to VRAM.  
· NO_VRAM: Indicates very low VRAM availability, prompting all options to be enabled to save VRAM.  
· LOW_VRAM: Represents a state where VRAM is low but not critically so.  
· NORMAL_VRAM: Indicates a standard level of VRAM availability.  
· HIGH_VRAM: Represents a high level of VRAM availability.  
· SHARED: Indicates that there is no dedicated VRAM, and memory is shared between the CPU and GPU, although models still need to be moved between both.

**Code Description**: The VRAMState class is an enumeration that defines different states of VRAM availability, which is crucial for managing the loading and unloading of models in a GPU environment. Each state signifies a specific condition regarding the VRAM's capacity and availability, guiding the system's behavior in terms of model management.

The VRAMState is utilized in various functions throughout the model management module. For instance, in the `free_memory` function, the current VRAM state is checked to determine whether to free up memory or to trigger a cache emptying process. If the VRAM state is not HIGH_VRAM, the function assesses the available memory and may call `soft_empty_cache()` to optimize memory usage.

In the `load_models_gpu` function, the VRAMState is critical for deciding how to load models based on the current VRAM conditions. Depending on the state, the function may adjust the memory allocated for models, ensuring that they are loaded efficiently without exceeding the available VRAM. For example, if the VRAM state is LOW_VRAM or NORMAL_VRAM, the function calculates the necessary memory for models and may switch to a lower VRAM state if the current memory is insufficient.

The `unet_offload_device` and `unet_inital_load_device` functions also rely on the VRAMState to determine the appropriate device for loading models. These functions check the VRAM state to decide whether to use the GPU or default to the CPU, ensuring optimal performance based on the current memory conditions.

Overall, the VRAMState enumeration plays a vital role in the model management process, influencing how models are loaded, unloaded, and managed in relation to the available VRAM.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the VRAMState is accurately maintained throughout the model management process to prevent memory-related issues and to optimize performance when working with GPU resources.

**Code Description**: The get_total_memory function is designed to determine the total memory available on a specified device, which can be a CPU, GPU, or XPU. The function begins by checking if the device parameter (dev) is provided; if not, it calls the get_torch_device function to obtain the current device being used by PyTorch.

The function then checks the type of the device:
1. If the device is of type 'cpu' or 'mps' (Metal Performance Shaders), it retrieves the total virtual memory available on the system using the psutil library and assigns this value to both mem_total and mem_total_torch.
2. If the device is not a CPU or MPS, the function checks if DirectML is enabled through the global variable directml_enabled. If DirectML is enabled, it sets a placeholder value for mem_total (currently hardcoded as 1024 * 1024 * 1024 bytes) and assigns this to mem_total_torch as well.
3. If DirectML is not enabled, the function checks if the device is an Intel XPU by calling the is_intel_xpu function. If it is an Intel XPU, the function retrieves memory statistics using the torch.xpu.memory_stats function and gets the total memory using torch.xpu.get_device_properties. It assigns the reserved memory to mem_total_torch.
4. If the device is neither a CPU, MPS, nor an Intel XPU, the function assumes it is a CUDA device. It retrieves memory statistics using torch.cuda.memory_stats and obtains the total memory available for the CUDA device using torch.cuda.mem_get_info. The reserved memory is assigned to mem_total_torch.

Finally, based on the value of the torch_total_too parameter, the function either returns a tuple containing both mem_total and mem_total_torch or just the total memory (mem_total).

The get_total_memory function is closely related to other functions in the model management module, particularly get_torch_device and is_intel_xpu. It relies on get_torch_device to determine the current device and uses is_intel_xpu to check for the presence of Intel XPU hardware, which influences how memory is reported.

· device: This parameter represents the device for which the name and type are to be retrieved. It can be a CUDA device or an Intel XPU.

**Code Description**: The get_torch_device_name function begins by checking if the provided device has an attribute named 'type'. If it does, and the type is "cuda", the function attempts to retrieve the allocator backend using torch.cuda.get_allocator_backend(). If this call fails, it assigns an empty string to allocator_backend. The function then constructs and returns a string that includes the device, its name obtained from torch.cuda.get_device_name(device), and the allocator backend.

If the device type is not "cuda", the function simply returns the type of the device as a string. In cases where the device does not have a 'type' attribute, the function checks if the system is utilizing an Intel XPU by calling the is_intel_xpu function. If the system is confirmed to be using an Intel XPU, it returns a string that includes the device and its name obtained from torch.xpu.get_device_name(device). 

If none of the previous conditions are met, the function defaults to returning a string formatted as "CUDA {device}: {device_name}", where device_name is retrieved using torch.cuda.get_device_name(device).

The state dictionary, obtained via the module's state_dict() method, contains all the parameters of the module, including weights and biases. For each parameter tensor in the state dictionary, the function calculates the number of elements (using the nelement() method) and multiplies it by the size of each element in bytes (using the element_size() method). The cumulative sum of these products gives the total memory size of the module, which is then returned as an integer value representing the size in bytes.

This function is called in two different contexts within the project. 

1. In the model_load method of the LoadedModel class, module_size is utilized to determine the memory size of each module when loading a model in low VRAM mode. The function helps to ensure that the total memory used by the modules does not exceed the specified lowvram_model_memory limit. If the cumulative memory size of the modules being loaded is within this limit, the module is moved to the specified device.

2. In the model_size method of the ModelPatcher class, module_size is called to compute the size of the model.

· device: The device on which the model is loaded (e.g., CPU or GPU).

**Code Description**: The LoadedModel class is designed to facilitate the management of machine learning models, particularly in terms of loading them onto specific devices and handling memory requirements. Upon initialization, the class takes a model as an argument and sets up necessary attributes such as the model's loading device and its current acceleration state.

The method `model_memory()` calculates the memory size required by the model by invoking the `model_size()` method of the model object. The `model_memory_required(device)` method determines the additional memory needed based on the current device. If the model is already on the specified device, it returns zero; otherwise, it returns the model's memory size.

The `model_load(lowvram_model_memory=0)` method is responsible for loading the model onto the specified device. It handles low VRAM scenarios by checking the available memory and adjusting the loading process accordingly. If low VRAM is specified, it attempts to load the model modules selectively based on their memory size, ensuring that the total memory used does not exceed the specified limit. This method also includes error handling to manage exceptions during the loading process, ensuring that the model can be unloaded and restored to a previous state if necessary.

The `model_unload()` method is used to unload the model from the device, reverting any changes made during the acceleration process. It restores the model's previous state and ensures that the model is properly unpatched from the offload device.

The `__eq__(self, other)` method allows for comparison between two LoadedModel instances based on their underlying model objects.

It achieves this by invoking the model_size method from the ModelPatcher class, which is accessed through the model attribute of the LoadedModel instance. The model_size function calculates the size of the model by checking if the size has already been computed and stored. If the size is greater than zero, it returns the pre-calculated size. If not, it computes the size by accessing the model's state dictionary and summing the memory footprints of its parameters.

The model_memory function serves as a convenient interface for obtaining the model's memory size when needed, particularly in scenarios where memory management is crucial. It is called by the model_memory_required method of the LoadedModel class. The model_memory_required function checks if the current device matches the device of the model. If they are the same, it returns zero, indicating no additional memory is required. If they differ, it calls the model_memory function to retrieve the model's memory size, which can then be used to assess memory requirements for operations on different devices.

**Note**: It is essential to ensure that the model associated with the LoadedModel instance is valid and properly initialized, as the model_memory function relies on the model_size method to provide accurate memory size information.

**Output Example**: A possible return value of the model_memory function could be an integer such as 2048000, indicating that the total memory size of the model is approximately 2 MB.

If the devices are the same, the function returns zero, indicating that no additional memory is required for the model on that device. This is a crucial optimization as it avoids unnecessary memory calculations when the model is already on the correct device.

If the devices differ, the function calls the model_memory method of the LoadedModel class to retrieve the memory size of the model. This method, model_memory, accesses the model's memory size in bytes, which is essential for understanding the memory footprint of the model when it is loaded onto a different device. The model_memory function is responsible for calculating the memory size by checking if it has been previously computed and stored, or by summing the memory footprints of the model's parameters if it has not.

The model_memory_required function is called within the load_models_gpu function, which is responsible for loading models onto GPU devices. In this context, load_models_gpu utilizes model_memory_required to determine the total memory required for each model being loaded. It aggregates these memory requirements to manage memory allocation effectively across different devices, ensuring that sufficient memory is available for the models being loaded. This relationship highlights the importance of model_memory_required in the broader context of memory management during model loading operations.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the model associated with the LoadedModel instance is valid and properly initialized, as the model_memory function relies on the model_size method to provide accurate memory size information.

**Output Example**: A possible return value of the model_memory_required function could be an integer such as 0, indicating that no additional memory is required when the model is on the same device, or an integer like 2048000, indicating that the model requires approximately 2 MB of memory when loaded onto a different device.
***
### FunctionDef model_load(self, lowvram_model_memory)
**model_load**: The function of model_load is to load a model onto a specified device, applying necessary patches and managing memory usage effectively.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· lowvram_model_memory: An integer that specifies the amount of memory (in bytes) to allocate for loading the model in low VRAM mode. A value of 0 indicates that the model should be loaded normally without low VRAM optimizations.

**Code Description**: The model_load function is responsible for loading a model into memory and preparing it for inference on a specified device. The function begins by determining the appropriate device for loading the model based on the lowvram_model_memory parameter. If this parameter is set to 0, the model will be loaded onto the device specified by self.device.

The function then calls self.model.model_patches_to(self.device) to transfer the model patches to the specified device, ensuring that any necessary optimizations are applied. It also invokes self.model.model_patches_to(self.model.model_dtype()) to configure the model according to its data type.

Next, the function attempts to patch the model using self.model.patch_model(device_to=patch_model_to). If an exception occurs during this process, the function will call self.model.unpatch_model(self.model.offload_device) to revert any changes made to the model, followed by a call to self.model_unload() to ensure that the model is unloaded properly. This error handling is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the model's state.

If lowvram_model_memory is greater than 0, the function enters a loop to load the model in low VRAM mode. It iterates through the modules of the real_model, checking for specific attributes that indicate compatibility with low VRAM optimizations. The function calculates the memory size of each module using the module_size function and ensures that the cumulative memory used does not exceed the specified lowvram_model_memory limit. Modules that fit within this limit are transferred to the specified device.

Additionally, if the system is using an Intel XPU and the IPEX hijack is not disabled, the function optimizes the model using torch.xpu.optimize, which enhances performance for inference.

Finally, the function returns the loaded model (self.real_model), which is now ready for inference.

The model_load function is called by the load_models_gpu function, which manages the loading of multiple models onto the GPU. This higher-level function handles the overall memory management and ensures that models are loaded efficiently based on the available resources.

***
### FunctionDef model_unload(self)
**model_unload**: The function of model_unload is to unload the model from memory and restore its parameters to their original state.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· None

**Code Description**: The model_unload function is responsible for unloading the model and reverting any changes made during the model's operation. It first checks if the model has been accelerated by examining the model_accelerated attribute. If the model is accelerated, it iterates through the modules of the real_model, checking for the presence of a specific attribute, prev_ldm_patched_cast_weights. If this attribute exists, the function restores the original weights from prev_ldm_patched_cast_weights back to ldm_patched_cast_weights and then deletes the prev_ldm_patched_cast_weights attribute to clean up.

After handling the accelerated model, the function proceeds to call unpatch_model on the model, passing the offload_device as an argument. This action restores the model's parameters and attributes to their backed-up states, effectively undoing any modifications made during the patching process. Following this, it calls model_patches_to with the offload_device to ensure that any model patches are transferred to the appropriate device, thereby managing resources effectively when the model is unloaded.

The model_unload function is invoked in several contexts within the project. It is called by the model_load function to ensure that the model is properly unloaded if an exception occurs during the loading process, thus maintaining the integrity of the model's state. Additionally, it is called in the unload_model_clones function, which iterates through currently loaded models to unload any clones of the specified model. The cleanup_models function also utilizes model_unload to remove models that are no longer referenced, ensuring efficient memory management.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the model is in a consistent state before calling model_unload, as it relies on the existence of backup states for restoring parameters. Additionally, care should be taken when managing the offload_device to avoid compatibility issues with the model's patches and configurations.
***
### FunctionDef __eq__(self, other)
**__eq__**: The function of __eq__ is to compare two LoadedModel instances for equality based on their model attributes.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· parameter1: self - An instance of the LoadedModel class that is being compared.
· parameter2: other - Another instance of the LoadedModel class to compare against.

**Code Description**: The __eq__ method is a special method in Python that allows for the comparison of two objects for equality. In this implementation, the method checks if the 'model' attribute of the current instance (self) is the same object as the 'model' attribute of the other instance (other). The comparison is done using the 'is' operator, which checks for object identity rather than equality of values. If both 'model' attributes refer to the same object in memory, the method returns True, indicating that the two LoadedModel instances are considered equal. If they do not refer to the same object, it returns False.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the 'model' attribute is defined for both instances before calling this method, as the behavior is dependent on the existence and identity of these attributes. This method is typically used in scenarios where LoadedModel instances need to be compared, such as in collections or when checking for duplicates.

**Output Example**: If two LoadedModel instances, model_a and model_b, are created with the same model object, calling model_a == model_b will return True. Conversely, if they are created with different model objects, the same call will return False.

In the load_models_gpu function, minimum_inference_memory is utilized to establish a baseline for the amount of memory that must be available when loading models. It ensures that the system has sufficient memory to accommodate the models being loaded, factoring in any additional memory requirements specified by the user.

In the should_use_fp16 function, minimum_inference_memory is used to calculate the available memory when determining if FP16 should be employed. The function checks if the free memory on the device, adjusted by the minimum inference memory, is sufficient to support the model parameters. If the available memory is less than the required amount, the function may opt to use FP16 to optimize performance.

**Note**: It is important to understand that this function does not take any parameters and always returns the same value. It serves as a constant reference point for memory calculations throughout the codebase.

**Output Example**: The return value of the minimum_inference_memory function is 1073741824, which corresponds to 1 gigabyte in bytes.
## FunctionDef unload_model_clones(model)
**unload_model_clones**: The function of unload_model_clones is to identify and unload all clone instances of a specified model from memory.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· parameter1: model - The model instance for which clones are to be identified and unloaded.

**Code Description**: The unload_model_clones function operates by first initializing an empty list called to_unload, which will store the indices of models that are identified as clones of the specified model. The function then iterates over the global list current_loaded_models, which contains all currently loaded model instances. For each model in this list, it checks if the current model is a clone of the specified model using the is_clone method. If a clone is detected, its index is added to the to_unload list.

Once all clones have been identified, the function proceeds to unload each clone. It does this by iterating over the indices stored in to_unload, printing a message indicating which clone is being unloaded, and then calling the model_unload method on the corresponding model instance. This effectively removes the clone from memory and restores its parameters to their original state.

The unload_model_clones function is called within the load_models_gpu function, which is responsible for loading new models into memory. Before loading a new model, it invokes unload_model_clones to ensure that any existing clones of the model being loaded are removed, thereby managing memory efficiently and preventing potential conflicts with model parameters.

Additionally, unload_model_clones is also called within the get_key_patches method of the ModelPatcher class. This ensures that any clones of the model being patched are unloaded before the new patches are applied, maintaining the integrity of the model's state.

**Note**: It is crucial to ensure that the model parameter passed to unload_model_clones is a valid model instance. The function relies on the proper implementation of the is_clone method to accurately identify clones. Failure to do so may result in unexpected behavior, such as failing to unload the correct models or leaving clones in memory.
## FunctionDef free_memory(memory_required, device, keep_loaded)
**free_memory**: The function of free_memory is to manage the unloading of models from memory to free up the required amount of memory on a specified device.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· memory_required: This parameter specifies the amount of memory that needs to be freed on the device.  
· device: This parameter indicates the specific device (e.g., CPU or GPU) from which memory should be freed.  
· keep_loaded: This optional parameter is a list of models that should remain loaded in memory and not be unloaded during the operation.

**Code Description**: The free_memory function is designed to optimize memory usage by unloading models that are currently loaded on a specified device. It begins by checking if the amount of free memory on the device meets the memory_required threshold. If the condition is satisfied, the function exits early without unloading any models.

The function iterates through the list of currently loaded models in reverse order. For each model, it checks if the model is on the specified device and whether it is not included in the keep_loaded list. If both conditions are met, the model is unloaded using its model_unload method, and the unloaded model is deleted from memory. A flag, unloaded_model, is set to True to indicate that at least one model has been unloaded.

If any models were unloaded during the process, the function calls soft_empty_cache to clear any remaining cached memory, thereby optimizing memory usage further. If no models were unloaded and the VRAM state is not HIGH_VRAM, the function checks the total free memory available on the device. If the free memory for PyTorch operations exceeds 25% of the total free memory, it again calls soft_empty_cache to clear the cache.

The free_memory function is called by other functions within the model management module, notably load_models_gpu and unload_all_models. In load_models_gpu, free_memory is invoked to ensure that sufficient memory is available before loading new models. It calculates the total memory required for the new models and calls free_memory to unload any existing models that are not in use. In unload_all_models, free_memory is called with a very high memory_required value to unload all models from the device, effectively clearing the memory.

This function plays a crucial role in managing memory efficiently in a GPU environment, ensuring that the system can handle model loading and unloading dynamically based on the current memory state.

**Note**: It is essential to ensure that the keep_loaded list is correctly populated with models that should remain in memory to avoid unintended unloading of necessary models. Additionally, the function relies on accurate tracking of the current loaded models and their respective devices to function correctly.
## FunctionDef load_models_gpu(models, memory_required)
**load_models_gpu**: The function of load_models_gpu is to manage the loading of multiple machine learning models onto GPU devices while ensuring efficient memory usage.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· parameter1: models - A list of models to be loaded onto the GPU.  
· parameter2: memory_required - An integer specifying the minimum amount of memory required for loading the models, defaulting to 0.

**Code Description**: The load_models_gpu function is designed to facilitate the loading of specified machine learning models onto GPU devices, taking into account the available memory and the current state of loaded models. 

The function begins by determining the minimum inference memory required using the minimum_inference_memory function, which returns a constant value of 1 GB. It then calculates the extra memory needed based on the provided memory_required parameter. 

Next, the function initializes two lists: models_to_load, which will hold models that need to be loaded, and models_already_loaded, which will track models that are already in memory. For each model in the input list, it creates an instance of the LoadedModel class. If the model is already loaded, it is moved to the front of the current_loaded_models list, and its reference is added to models_already_loaded. If the model is not already loaded, it is prepared for loading.

If there are no models to load, the function identifies the devices of the already loaded models and frees up memory on those devices if they are not CPU devices. This is done using the free_memory function, which unloads models to ensure sufficient memory is available.

If there are models to load, the function calculates the total memory required for the new models and invokes free_memory to ensure that enough memory is available on the respective devices. It then proceeds to load each model, adjusting for low VRAM scenarios if necessary. The VRAMState enumeration is used to determine the current state of VRAM availability, guiding the loading process. 

The function also includes error handling to manage potential issues during model loading, ensuring that models are unloaded properly if an error occurs. Finally, the loaded models are added to the current_loaded_models list, making them available for inference.

The load_models_gpu function is called by various other functions throughout the project, including load_model_gpu, prepare_sampling, and save_checkpoint. These functions rely on load_models_gpu to ensure that the necessary models are loaded into memory before performing their respective operations. This highlights the function's critical role in managing model loading and memory utilization within the GPU environment.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the models passed to the function are compatible with the specified devices and that memory constraints are taken into account to avoid runtime errors.

**Output Example**: A possible return value from the function could be None, indicating that the models have been successfully loaded onto the GPU without any errors.
## FunctionDef load_model_gpu(model)
**load_model_gpu**: The function of load_model_gpu is to facilitate the loading of a specified machine learning model onto GPU devices for efficient inference.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· parameter1: model - A single machine learning model that needs to be loaded onto the GPU.

**Code Description**: The load_model_gpu function is designed to streamline the process of loading a specified model onto GPU devices by invoking the load_models_gpu function with a list containing the model. This encapsulation allows for the handling of multiple models if necessary, while in this case, it focuses on a single model input.

When load_model_gpu is called, it takes the provided model and wraps it in a list before passing it to load_models_gpu. This design ensures that the loading mechanism can leverage the existing functionality of load_models_gpu, which manages memory requirements, device compatibility, and the actual loading process onto the GPU.

The load_models_gpu function performs several critical tasks:
1. It checks the available memory and determines if the model can be loaded without exceeding the limits.
2. It manages the state of currently loaded models, ensuring that if the model is already loaded, it is efficiently utilized rather than reloaded.
3. It handles potential errors during the loading process to maintain stability and performance.

The load_model_gpu function is called by various components within the project, including the predict_with_caption method in the GroundingDinoModel class, the censor method in the Censor class, and the __call__ method in the FooocusExpansion class, among others. Each of these functions relies on load_model_gpu to ensure that the necessary models are loaded into memory before executing their respective tasks, highlighting the function's integral role in the overall model management system.

**Note**: It is essential to ensure that the model passed to the function is compatible with the specified GPU devices and that memory constraints are considered to avoid runtime errors.

**Output Example**: A possible return value from the function could be None, indicating that the model has been successfully loaded onto the GPU without any errors.
## FunctionDef cleanup_models
**cleanup_models**: The function of cleanup_models is to manage memory by unloading models that are no longer referenced.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· None

**Code Description**: The cleanup_models function is designed to identify and remove models from memory that are no longer in use, thereby optimizing resource management. It begins by initializing an empty list called to_delete, which will hold the indices of models that are eligible for deletion.

The function iterates through the list of currently loaded models, referred to as current_loaded_models. For each model, it checks the reference count of the model's underlying object using sys.getrefcount. If the reference count is less than or equal to 2, it indicates that the model is no longer actively referenced elsewhere in the program. In such cases, the index of the model is added to the to_delete list.

Once the iteration is complete, the function proceeds to unload the models identified for deletion. It does this by iterating through the to_delete list, popping each model from current_loaded_models. For each model that is removed, the model_unload method is called to ensure that the model is properly unloaded from memory and that any associated resources are released. Finally, the model object is deleted to free up memory.

The cleanup_models function is crucial for maintaining efficient memory usage within the application, particularly in scenarios where models are dynamically loaded and unloaded. It works in conjunction with the model_unload method, which is responsible for reverting the model to its original state and managing any necessary cleanup tasks. This relationship ensures that when models are no longer needed, they are effectively removed from memory, preventing memory leaks and ensuring that system resources are utilized efficiently.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the models being unloaded are not in use elsewhere in the application to avoid unintended side effects. Proper management of model references is essential to maintain application stability and performance.
## FunctionDef dtype_size(dtype)
**dtype_size**: The function of dtype_size is to determine the size in bytes of a given data type in PyTorch.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· dtype: The data type for which the size in bytes is to be calculated.

**Code Description**: The dtype_size function takes a single parameter, dtype, which represents the data type in PyTorch. The function initializes a variable dtype_size to 4, which corresponds to the size of a float32 data type. It then checks if the provided dtype is either float16 or bfloat16, in which case it sets dtype_size to 2, reflecting their smaller size in bytes. If the dtype is float32, dtype_size remains 4. For any other dtype, the function attempts to access the itemsize attribute, which provides the size in bytes for that data type. If the itemsize attribute is not available (as in older versions of PyTorch), it simply retains the default value of dtype_size. Finally, the function returns the calculated size in bytes.

This function is called by several other functions within the project, including inference_memory_requirements in the ControlLora class, memory_required in the BaseModel class, and unet_inital_load_device. In inference_memory_requirements, dtype_size is used to calculate the memory requirements based on the control weights and the specified data type. In memory_required, it is utilized to determine the memory needed for a given input shape, factoring in the data type. In unet_inital_load_device, dtype_size helps assess the model size based on the parameters and the specified data type, which influences the decision on whether to load the model on the GPU or CPU based on available memory.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the dtype passed to the function is a valid PyTorch data type to avoid unexpected behavior. The function is designed to handle common data types, but users should be aware of potential compatibility issues with older versions of PyTorch that may not support the itemsize attribute.

**Output Example**: For a call to dtype_size(torch.float32), the expected return value would be 4, indicating that the size of float32 is 4 bytes. For a call to dtype_size(torch.float16), the return value would be 2, and for an unsupported dtype, it would return the default or calculated itemsize value.

Finally, the function checks if the device belongs to the NVIDIA 16 series (e.g., 1660, 1650). If it does, it returns False, as FP16 is known to be problematic on these cards. If none of the conditions lead to a definitive answer, it defaults to returning True, indicating that FP16 can be used.

This function is called by several other functions within the model management module, including unet_dtype, text_encoder_dtype, load_ip_adapter, and load_gligen. These functions rely on should_use_fp16 to determine the appropriate data type for model operations based on the current device and memory conditions.

**Note**: It is crucial to ensure that the global variables and device states are correctly initialized before invoking the should_use_fp16 function to prevent unexpected behavior.

**Output Example**: A possible return value of the function could be:
- True (if the device supports FP16 and conditions are met)
- False (if the device is a CPU, or if certain flags or conditions indicate FP16 should not be used)
## FunctionDef soft_empty_cache(force)
**soft_empty_cache**: The function of soft_empty_cache is to clear the memory cache of the current processing device based on the system's CPU state.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· force: A boolean value that determines whether to forcibly clear the CUDA cache (default is False).

**Code Description**: The soft_empty_cache function is designed to manage memory by clearing the cache of the processing device being utilized, which can help alleviate memory issues during computation. The function first checks the global variable cpu_state to determine the current processing state of the system, which is defined by the CPUState enumeration. 

- If the cpu_state is set to CPUState.MPS, indicating that the Metal Performance Shaders are in use, the function calls `torch.mps.empty_cache()` to clear the MPS cache.
- If the system is identified as utilizing an Intel XPU (checked via the is_intel_xpu function), it invokes `torch.xpu.empty_cache()` to clear the XPU cache.
- If CUDA is available and the cpu_state is set to GPU, the function checks the force parameter or whether the system is using an NVIDIA GPU (verified by the is_nvidia function). If either condition is satisfied, it calls `torch.cuda.empty_cache()` to clear the CUDA cache and `torch.cuda.ipc_collect()` to perform inter-process communication collection.

This function is particularly important in scenarios where memory management is critical, such as during large model training or inference tasks. It is invoked in various parts of the codebase, notably in the attention_split and slice_attention functions, where memory allocation can lead to out-of-memory (OOM) errors. In these functions, when an OOM exception is caught, soft_empty_cache is called to attempt to free up memory before retrying the operation.

Additionally, the soft_empty_cache function is also called within the free_memory function, which manages the unloading of models based on memory requirements. If the function determines that models need to be unloaded to free up memory, it subsequently calls soft_empty_cache to ensure that any remaining cached memory is cleared.

**Note**: It is essential to ensure that the global variable cpu_state is correctly set before invoking the soft_empty_cache function to avoid unexpected behavior. The function's effectiveness in managing memory relies on accurate identification of the current processing state and the availability of the respective hardware capabilities.
## FunctionDef unload_all_models
**unload_all_models**: The function of unload_all_models is to free up memory by unloading all currently loaded models from the specified device.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· There are no parameters for this function.

**Code Description**: The unload_all_models function is designed to optimize memory usage by invoking the free_memory function with a very high memory_required value. This effectively triggers the unloading of all models currently loaded in memory on the specified device. The function first calls get_torch_device to determine the appropriate device (CPU, GPU, or XPU) based on the current system configuration. It then passes a large memory requirement (1e30) to the free_memory function, which is intended to ensure that all models are unloaded, regardless of their current memory usage.

The unload_all_models function is integral to managing memory within the model management module. It is particularly useful in scenarios where a complete reset of the loaded models is necessary, such as when switching between different tasks or configurations that require different models. By ensuring that all models are unloaded, the function helps to prevent memory overflow and optimizes the available resources for subsequent operations.

The relationship with its callees is significant; unload_all_models relies on both get_torch_device and free_memory to perform its task. The get_torch_device function determines the correct device to target for unloading models, while free_memory handles the actual process of unloading based on the specified memory requirement. This collaboration ensures that the function operates efficiently and effectively within the broader context of model management.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the system's global state is correctly configured before invoking unload_all_models, as it relies on accurate device detection and memory management to function as intended.

## ClassDef InterruptProcessingException
**InterruptProcessingException**: The function of InterruptProcessingException is to signal an interruption in the processing flow.

**attributes**: The attributes of this Class.
· None

**Code Description**: The InterruptProcessingException class is a custom exception that inherits from the built-in Exception class in Python. It serves as a specific signal to indicate that a processing operation has been interrupted, allowing the program to handle this situation gracefully. This exception does not add any new attributes or methods beyond those provided by the base Exception class, making it a straightforward implementation.

This exception is utilized in various parts of the project, particularly in functions that involve processing tasks that may be interrupted by user actions. For instance, in the function `throw_exception_if_processing_interrupted`, the global variable `interrupt_processing` is checked, and if it is set to True, the exception is raised. This indicates that the ongoing processing should be halted, and the control should be returned to the caller to handle the interruption appropriately.

Moreover, the `InterruptProcessingException` is caught in the `enhance_upscale` function and the `handler` function within the `modules/async_worker.py/worker` module. In these contexts, the exception is used to determine whether the user has chosen to skip or stop the processing. If the exception is raised, the processing can either continue with a skip or break out of the loop, depending on the user's last action. This demonstrates the exception's role in managing user interactions during potentially long-running tasks, ensuring that the application remains responsive to user commands.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the global state variables, such as `interrupt_processing`, are managed correctly to avoid unintended interruptions. Proper handling of the InterruptProcessingException is crucial to maintain the integrity of the processing flow and provide a smooth user experience.
## FunctionDef interrupt_current_processing(value)
**interrupt_current_processing**: The function of interrupt_current_processing is to control the interruption of ongoing processing tasks by setting a global flag.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· value: A boolean value that determines whether to interrupt the current processing. The default is True.

**Code Description**: The interrupt_current_processing function is designed to manage the state of a global variable, interrupt_processing, which indicates whether the current processing should be interrupted. It utilizes a mutex, interrupt_processing_mutex, to ensure that the operation of setting this global variable is thread-safe. This is crucial in a multi-threaded environment where concurrent access to shared resources can lead to inconsistent states or race conditions.

When this function is called, it acquires the mutex lock, ensuring that no other thread can modify the interrupt_processing variable until the lock is released. After acquiring the lock, it sets the interrupt_processing variable to the value passed as an argument. If the value is True, it indicates that processing should be interrupted; if False, it indicates that processing should continue.

This function is called by several other components in the project. For instance, in the process_task function within the async_worker module, interrupt_current_processing is invoked when the async_task.last_stop is not False, indicating that a task should be halted. Similarly, in the stop_clicked and skip_clicked functions within the webui module, this function is called to interrupt processing when a user action is detected, such as stopping or skipping a task. These calls demonstrate the function's role in providing a mechanism to halt ongoing tasks based on user input or task state, thereby enhancing the control over task execution in the application.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the interrupt_current_processing function is used in conjunction with proper handling of the processing state to avoid unintended interruptions. Additionally, developers should be aware of the implications of modifying global variables and ensure that the mutex is always used to maintain thread safety.
## FunctionDef processing_interrupted
**processing_interrupted**: The function of processing_interrupted is to check and return the current state of the processing interruption flag.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· There are no parameters for this function.

**Code Description**: The processing_interrupted function is designed to safely access a global variable named interrupt_processing, which indicates whether the processing has been interrupted. The function uses a mutex lock, interrupt_processing_mutex, to ensure that access to the interrupt_processing variable is thread-safe. This means that while one thread is checking the value of interrupt_processing, no other thread can modify it, preventing potential race conditions. The function acquires the mutex lock using a context manager (the with statement), which automatically handles the release of the lock once the block of code is exited. After acquiring the lock, the function returns the current value of interrupt_processing, which is expected to be a boolean indicating whether processing is currently interrupted or not.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the global variables interrupt_processing and interrupt_processing_mutex are properly initialized before calling this function. Additionally, this function should be used in a multi-threaded environment where the state of processing may change concurrently.

**Output Example**: A possible return value of the function could be `True` if the processing has been interrupted, or `False` if it is currently running without interruption.
## FunctionDef throw_exception_if_processing_interrupted
**throw_exception_if_processing_interrupted**: The function of throw_exception_if_processing_interrupted is to check for an interruption in processing and raise an exception if such an interruption is detected.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· None

**Code Description**: The throw_exception_if_processing_interrupted function is designed to monitor a global state variable, `interrupt_processing`, which indicates whether an ongoing processing task should be interrupted. The function utilizes a mutex, `interrupt_processing_mutex`, to ensure that the check and potential modification of the `interrupt_processing` variable are thread-safe, preventing race conditions in a multi-threaded environment.

Upon invocation, the function acquires the mutex lock to safely access the `interrupt_processing` variable. It checks if `interrupt_processing` is set to True, which signifies that an interruption has been requested. If this condition is met, the function resets `interrupt_processing` to False, effectively signaling that the interruption has been acknowledged. Subsequently, it raises an `InterruptProcessingException`, a custom exception defined elsewhere in the codebase. This exception serves as a clear signal to the calling context that the processing operation has been interrupted and should be handled accordingly.

The throw_exception_if_processing_interrupted function is called in two specific contexts within the project. First, it is invoked in the before_node_execution function, which likely serves as a preparatory step before executing a node in a processing pipeline. By calling this function, before_node_execution ensures that any ongoing processing is checked for interruptions before proceeding.

Second, it is also called within the callback function of a sampling process. In this context, the function is used to verify if the processing should continue or be interrupted during a series of steps in a callback mechanism. This highlights the function's role in maintaining responsiveness to user commands during potentially lengthy operations, allowing for graceful handling of interruptions.

Overall, the throw_exception_if_processing_interrupted function plays a critical role in managing the flow of processing tasks, ensuring that user requests for interruption are respected and handled properly through the raising of the InterruptProcessingException.

**Note**: It is essential to manage the global state variables, such as `interrupt_processing`, with care to prevent unintended interruptions. Proper handling of the InterruptProcessingException is vital to maintain the integrity of the processing flow and ensure a smooth user experience.
