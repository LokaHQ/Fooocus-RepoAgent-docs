## FunctionDef is_pytorch_sr_model(model)
**is_pytorch_sr_model**: The function of is_pytorch_sr_model is to determine if a given model is an instance of the PyTorchSRModels class.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· model: An object that is to be checked against the PyTorchSRModels class.

**Code Description**: The function is_pytorch_sr_model takes a single parameter, model, which is expected to be an object. It utilizes the built-in isinstance function to check if the provided model is an instance of the PyTorchSRModels class. The function returns a boolean value: True if the model is indeed an instance of PyTorchSRModels, and False otherwise. This functionality is particularly useful in scenarios where it is necessary to validate the type of a model before performing operations that are specific to PyTorchSRModels.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the PyTorchSRModels class is defined and imported in the context where this function is used. The function does not handle any exceptions or errors related to the input type; it simply checks the instance type.

**Output Example**: If the input model is an instance of PyTorchSRModels, the function will return True. If the input model is not an instance of PyTorchSRModels, it will return False. For example:
- Input: model = PyTorchSRModels() → Output: True
- Input: model = SomeOtherModel() → Output: False
## FunctionDef is_pytorch_face_model(model)
**is_pytorch_face_model**: The function of is_pytorch_face_model is to determine if a given model is an instance of the PyTorchFaceModels class.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· model: An object that is to be checked against the PyTorchFaceModels class.

**Code Description**: The is_pytorch_face_model function takes a single parameter, model, which is expected to be an object. The function utilizes the built-in isinstance() function to check if the provided model is an instance of the PyTorchFaceModels class. If the model is indeed an instance of PyTorchFaceModels, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False. This function is particularly useful in scenarios where it is necessary to validate the type of a model before performing operations that are specific to PyTorchFaceModels, ensuring that the subsequent code executes without type-related errors.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the PyTorchFaceModels class is defined and accessible in the scope where this function is used. If the class is not defined, the function will raise a NameError.

**Output Example**: 
- If the input model is an instance of PyTorchFaceModels, the function will return: True
- If the input model is not an instance of PyTorchFaceModels, the function will return: False
## FunctionDef is_pytorch_inpaint_model(model)
**is_pytorch_inpaint_model**: The function of is_pytorch_inpaint_model is to determine if a given model is an instance of the PyTorchInpaintModels class.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· model: An object that is to be checked against the PyTorchInpaintModels class.

**Code Description**: The is_pytorch_inpaint_model function takes a single parameter, model, which is expected to be an object. The function utilizes the isinstance() built-in function to check if the provided model is an instance of the PyTorchInpaintModels class. If the model is indeed an instance of PyTorchInpaintModels, the function will return True; otherwise, it will return False. This function is useful for validating the type of model being used in contexts where specific model types are required, particularly in applications involving image inpainting with PyTorch.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the PyTorchInpaintModels class is defined and accessible in the scope where this function is used. Additionally, the function does not perform any type conversion or error handling; it strictly checks the instance type.

**Output Example**: If the input model is an instance of PyTorchInpaintModels, the function will return True. If the input model is of a different type, it will return False. For example:
- Input: model = PyTorchInpaintModels() → Output: True
- Input: model = SomeOtherModel() → Output: False
