## FunctionDef moment(x, dim, k)
**moment**: The function of moment is to compute the k-th moment of a 4-dimensional tensor along specified dimensions.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· x: A 4-dimensional tensor for which the moment is to be calculated.
· dim: A tuple specifying the dimensions along which to compute the moment. Default is (2, 3).
· k: An integer representing the order of the moment to compute. Default is 2.

**Code Description**: The moment function begins by asserting that the input tensor `x` has exactly four dimensions. This is crucial as the function is designed to operate on 4D tensors, typically representing batches of multi-channel images. The function then calculates the mean of the tensor `x` along the specified dimensions `dim` (defaulting to dimensions 2 and 3, which are often the height and width of an image). The mean is reshaped to maintain the tensor's dimensionality by adding two singleton dimensions at the end.

Next, the function computes the k-th moment by first subtracting the mean from the original tensor `x`, raising the result to the power of `k`, and then summing the result along the specified dimensions. The sum is normalized by dividing by the product of the sizes of the dimensions being summed (i.e., the height and width of the tensor). This normalization ensures that the moment is scale-invariant and provides a meaningful statistical measure.

Finally, the computed moment `mk` is returned as the output of the function.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the input tensor `x` has four dimensions; otherwise, the assertion will fail. Additionally, the choice of `k` should be made based on the specific statistical properties desired from the moment calculation.

**Output Example**: If the input tensor `x` is a 4D tensor of shape (N, C, H, W) where N is the batch size, C is the number of channels, and H and W are the height and width respectively, the output will be a tensor of shape (N, C) representing the k-th moment calculated over the specified dimensions. For instance, if `x` has a shape of (2, 3, 4, 4) and `k` is set to 2, the output might look like a tensor of shape (2, 3) containing the computed moments for each channel in each batch.
## ClassDef ESA
**ESA**: The function of ESA is to implement a modified version of Enhanced Spatial Attention for image super-resolution tasks.

**attributes**: The attributes of this Class.
· esa_channels: The number of channels used for the Enhanced Spatial Attention mechanism.  
· n_feats: The number of feature channels in the input tensor.  
· conv: The convolutional layer type, defaulting to nn.Conv2d.  
· conv1: A 1x1 convolutional layer that reduces the number of feature channels.  
· conv_f: A 1x1 convolutional layer used for feature fusion.  
· conv2: A 3x3 convolutional layer with stride 2 for downsampling.  
· conv3: A 3x3 convolutional layer for processing the downsampled features.  
· conv4: A 1x1 convolutional layer that projects the output back to the original feature channel size.  
· sigmoid: A sigmoid activation function used to generate attention weights.  
· relu: A ReLU activation function for non-linearity.

**Code Description**: The ESA class is a neural network module that implements a modified Enhanced Spatial Attention mechanism, as proposed in the paper "Residual Feature Aggregation Network for Image Super-Resolution." The class inherits from nn.Module, which is a base class for all neural network modules in PyTorch. 

In the constructor (__init__), the class initializes several convolutional layers that are essential for the attention mechanism. The first convolutional layer (conv1) reduces the number of input feature channels to esa_channels. The second convolutional layer (conv2) downsamples the feature map, while conv3 processes the downsampled features. The conv_f layer is used for feature fusion, and conv4 projects the combined features back to the original number of feature channels. The class also includes activation functions: sigmoid for generating attention weights and ReLU for introducing non-linearity.

The forward method defines the forward pass of the network. It takes an input tensor x, applies the convolutional layers, and computes the attention weights. The output is obtained by multiplying the input tensor x with the attention weights m, effectively enhancing the spatial features based on the learned attention.

The ESA class is utilized in the OSAG class, where it is instantiated with a specified number of channels. The OSAG class creates a residual layer and integrates the ESA module to enhance the feature representation during the image super-resolution process. This integration allows the OSAG class to leverage the spatial attention mechanism provided by ESA, thereby improving the overall performance of the model.

**Note**: Ensure that the input tensor x has the appropriate dimensions that match the expected input for the convolutional layers. The ESA module is designed to work within a larger architecture, so it should be used in conjunction with other components for optimal performance.

**Output Example**: Given an input tensor of shape (batch_size, n_feats, height, width), the output tensor will have the same shape, but the spatial features will be enhanced according to the learned attention weights. For instance, if the input tensor has a shape of (1, 64, 32, 32), the output will also have a shape of (1, 64, 32, 32), with modified feature values reflecting the attention mechanism.

**Code Description**: The __init__ function is the constructor for the ESA class, which is a part of a neural network architecture. It begins by calling the constructor of its parent class using `super(ESA, self).__init__()`, ensuring that any initialization in the parent class is also executed. 

The function takes three parameters: `esa_channels`, `n_feats`, and `conv`. The `esa_channels` parameter specifies the number of channels that the ESA module will use, while `n_feats` indicates the number of input features. The `conv` parameter allows the user to specify the type of convolutional layer to be used, with a default value of `nn.Conv2d`.

Inside the function, the variable `f` is assigned the value of `esa_channels`. Several convolutional layers are then defined:
- `self.conv1`: A 1x1 convolution that transforms the input from `n_feats` to `f` channels.
- `self.conv_f`: Another 1x1 convolution that maintains the number of channels at `f`.
- `self.conv2`: A 3x3 convolution with a stride of 2 and no padding, which reduces the spatial dimensions.
- `self.conv3`: A 3x3 convolution with padding of 1, preserving the spatial dimensions.
- `self.conv4`: A final 1x1 convolution that reduces the number of channels from `f` back to `n_feats`.

Additionally, two activation functions are instantiated: `self.sigmoid`, which applies the sigmoid activation function, and `self.relu`, which applies the ReLU activation function in-place.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the `esa_channels` and `n_feats` parameters are set appropriately to match the architecture of the neural network being constructed. The choice of the convolution operation can also affect the performance and behavior of the ESA module.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· x: A tensor representing the input data, typically an image or feature map.

**Code Description**: The forward function takes an input tensor `x` and applies a sequence of convolutional operations followed by pooling and interpolation to produce an output tensor. 

1. The input tensor `x` is first passed through the first convolutional layer `self.conv1`, resulting in an intermediate tensor `c1_`.
2. This intermediate tensor `c1_` is then processed by a second convolutional layer `self.conv2`, yielding another tensor `c1`.
3. The tensor `c1` undergoes max pooling with a kernel size of 7 and a stride of 3, which reduces its spatial dimensions and produces the tensor `v_max`.
4. The pooled tensor `v_max` is then passed through a third convolutional layer `self.conv3`, resulting in the tensor `c3`.
5. The tensor `c3` is resized to match the spatial dimensions of the original input tensor `x` using bilinear interpolation. This is done to ensure that the output tensor aligns with the input tensor's dimensions.
6. Simultaneously, the intermediate tensor `c1_` is processed through another convolutional layer `self.conv_f`, producing the tensor `cf`.
7. The tensors `c3` and `cf` are then added together and passed through a fourth convolutional layer `self.conv4`, resulting in the tensor `c4`.
8. Finally, a sigmoid activation function is applied to the tensor `c4`, producing a mask tensor `m`.
9. The output is computed by element-wise multiplying the original input tensor `x` with the mask tensor `m`, effectively applying the learned features to the input.

This sequence of operations enables the model to learn and apply complex transformations to the input data, enhancing its features based on the learned parameters of the convolutional layers.

**Note**: Ensure that the input tensor `x` has the appropriate dimensions expected by the convolutional layers. The output tensor will have the same spatial dimensions as the input tensor due to the interpolation step.

**Output Example**: If the input tensor `x` is of shape (1, 3, 224, 224), the output tensor will also be of shape (1, 3, 224, 224), representing the modified input after applying the forward function.

**Code Description**: The LK_ESA class inherits from nn.Module and is designed to create a lightweight and efficient channel attention mechanism. The constructor initializes several convolutional layers that are used to process the input feature maps. 

1. The first convolutional layer, `conv1`, reduces the number of feature channels from `n_feats` to `esa_channels` using a kernel size of 1. This layer serves as a preliminary feature extractor.
2. The `vec_conv` and `vec_conv3x1` layers apply convolutions with different kernel sizes to capture spatial features in the vertical direction. The `vec_conv` uses a kernel size of 17, while `vec_conv3x1` uses a kernel size of 3.
3. Similarly, `hor_conv` and `hor_conv1x3` layers are designed to capture horizontal spatial features, with `hor_conv` using a kernel size of 17 and `hor_conv1x3` using a kernel size of 3.
4. The `conv_f` layer is applied to the output of `conv1` to further process the features.
5. Finally, the `conv4` layer combines the results of the convolutions and the output from `conv_f`, producing a final feature map. The output is passed through a sigmoid activation function to generate attention weights, which are then multiplied with the original input `x` to produce the final output.

The use of group convolutions (with `groups=2`) in the `vec_conv`, `vec_conv3x1`, `hor_conv`, and `hor_conv1x3` layers allows for efficient computation and reduces the number of parameters, making the model lightweight.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the input tensor `x` has the appropriate number of channels matching `n_feats` for the model to function correctly. The model is designed to enhance feature representation, and the choice of `esa_channels` and `kernel_expand` can significantly impact performance.

**Output Example**: Given an input tensor `x` of shape (batch_size, n_feats, height, width), the output of the `forward` method will be a tensor of the same shape, where the values have been modulated by the attention mechanism, effectively enhancing the feature representation based on the learned attention weights.

Next, the function defines a kernel size of 17 and calculates the padding required for the convolution operations. The vec_conv and hor_conv layers are defined with specific kernel sizes and padding, utilizing group convolutions to separate the input channels into groups for more efficient processing. The vec_conv layer uses a kernel size of (1, 17) and the hor_conv layer uses a kernel size of (17, 1). Additionally, two more convolutional layers, vec_conv3x1 and hor_conv1x3, are defined with smaller kernel sizes of (1, 3) and (3, 1), respectively.

Finally, the function initializes another convolutional layer, conv4, which reduces the number of channels from f to n_feats, followed by the instantiation of activation functions: a Sigmoid and a ReLU. The use of these activation functions allows for non-linear transformations of the input data, which is essential for learning complex patterns in neural networks.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the input dimensions match the expected dimensions for the convolutional layers, particularly when using group convolutions. Additionally, the choice of kernel sizes and the number of channels should be carefully considered based on the specific requirements of the task at hand.

**Code Description**: The LK_ESA_LN class is a PyTorch neural network module that implements a specific architecture for feature extraction. It inherits from nn.Module, which is the base class for all neural network modules in PyTorch. 

In the constructor (__init__), the class initializes several convolutional layers and normalization layers. The first convolutional layer (conv1) transforms the input feature channels (n_feats) to the specified number of enhanced spatial attention channels (esa_channels). The class also defines additional convolutional layers for processing the features in both vertical and horizontal orientations, utilizing different kernel sizes and group convolutions to enhance the feature extraction process.

The forward method defines the forward pass of the network. It takes an input tensor x, applies layer normalization, and passes it through the initial convolutional layer.

The first convolutional layer, `conv1`, transforms the input from `n_feats` to `esa_channels`, while `conv_f` maintains the same number of channels. The kernel size for the convolutional operations is set to 17, with padding calculated to ensure that the spatial dimensions of the output match those of the input.

A LayerNorm2d instance is created to apply layer normalization to the feature maps, which is crucial for stabilizing the training process by normalizing the inputs to subsequent layers. This normalization is particularly important in deep learning models to mitigate issues related to internal covariate shift.

The function also sets up multiple convolutional layers (`vec_conv`, `vec_conv3x1`, `hor_conv`, and `hor_conv1x3`) that utilize different kernel sizes and group convolutions. These layers are designed to capture various spatial features in the input data, enhancing the model's ability to learn complex patterns. The use of groups in the convolutions allows for more efficient computations and can improve the model's performance.

Finally, the function initializes additional layers, including `conv4`, which transforms the output back to `n_feats`, and activation functions such as `sigmoid` and `relu`, which introduce non-linearity into the model.

The LK_ESA_LN class, through its __init__ method, establishes a comprehensive architecture that integrates convolutional operations and normalization, facilitating effective feature extraction and representation learning in the context of image processing tasks.

**Note**: When using the LK_ESA_LN class, ensure that the input tensor dimensions align with the expected shapes for the convolutional layers, typically (batch_size, channels, height, width), to avoid dimension mismatch errors during processing.

### FunctionDef forward(self, x)
**forward**: The function of forward is to process the input tensor through a series of convolutional operations and return a modified output tensor.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· x: A tensor input that represents the data to be processed.

**Code Description**: The forward function takes a tensor input `x` and applies several operations to it. First, it normalizes the input using `self.norm(x)`, which prepares the data for further processing. The normalized tensor is then passed through the first convolutional layer `self.conv1(c1_)`, producing an intermediate result stored in `c1_`.

Next, the function computes two separate convolutional operations on `c1_` using `self.vec_conv(c1_)` and `self.vec_conv3x1(c1_)`. The results of these operations are summed together to form the variable `res`. This `res` tensor is then further processed by two horizontal convolutional layers, `self.hor_conv(res)` and `self.hor_conv1x3(res)`, with their outputs also summed together.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the input tensor `x` is of the correct shape and type expected by the normalization and convolutional layers to avoid runtime errors. The output tensor will have the same shape as the input tensor `x`.

**Output Example**: If the input tensor `x` is a 4D tensor of shape (batch_size, channels, height, width), the output will also be a 4D tensor of the same shape, where each element has been modified based on the learned features from the convolutional operations. For example, if `x` is a tensor with shape (1, 3, 224, 224), the output will also have the shape (1, 3, 224, 224).

Next, the function initializes an adaptive average pooling layer (`self.gap`) that reduces the spatial dimensions of the input feature maps to a size of 1x1, effectively summarizing the input across its spatial dimensions. This is followed by the creation of a convolutional layer (`self.fc`) that takes the number of input channels specified by `n_feats` and outputs a single channel. The convolutional layer is configured with a kernel size of 1, no padding, a stride of 1, and is set to use a bias term. 

Additionally, the variable `self.r` is initialized to a value of 5, which may be used later in the class for defining the radius or neighborhood size for the guided filter operations.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the parameters passed to the __init__ function are compatible with the intended use of the AdaGuidedFilter class. The choice of `esa_channels` and `n_feats` should align with the dimensions of the input data to avoid runtime errors. The default values for `conv`, `kernel_expand`, and `bias` can be modified based on specific requirements of the model architecture being implemented.

### FunctionDef box_filter(self, x, r)
**box_filter**: The function of box_filter is to apply a box filter to the input tensor, effectively performing a convolution operation that averages pixel values within a specified radius.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· parameter1: x - A 4D tensor of shape (N, C, H, W) representing the input image(s), where N is the batch size, C is the number of channels, H is the height, and W is the width.
· parameter2: r - An integer representing the radius of the box filter, which determines the size of the kernel used for convolution.

**Code Description**: The box_filter function computes a box filter by creating a kernel that averages pixel values over a square region defined by the radius r. The kernel size is calculated as (2 * r + 1), resulting in a square kernel. The weight for each element in the kernel is determined by the inverse of the area of the kernel, which is 1 / (kernel_size^2). This weight is then multiplied by a tensor of ones to create the box kernel, which is structured to match the number of channels in the input tensor x.

The function utilizes the PyTorch function F.conv2d to perform the convolution operation. The convolution is applied with a stride of 1 and padding equal to the radius r, ensuring that the output tensor maintains the same spatial dimensions as the input tensor. The groups parameter is set to the number of channels, allowing the convolution to be applied independently to each channel of the input tensor.

The box_filter function is called within the forward method of the AdaGuidedFilter class. In this context, it is used to compute the mean and variance of the input tensor x. The mean is calculated by dividing the result of the box_filter applied to x by N, which is the output of the box_filter applied to a tensor of ones. The variance is computed using the box_filter applied to the square of x, adjusted by the mean. These statistical measures are then used to compute the output tensor m, which is a combination of the input tensor x and the computed mean, modulated by the variance.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the input tensor x is properly shaped and that the radius r is a non-negative integer to avoid runtime errors. The function is designed to work with tensors on the same device (CPU or GPU) as the input tensor.

**Output Example**: Given an input tensor x of shape (1, 3, 4, 4) and a radius r of 1, the output of the box_filter function will be a tensor of the same shape (1, 3, 4, 4), where each pixel value is the average of the surrounding pixels within the defined kernel size.

### FunctionDef forward(self, x)
**forward**: The function of forward is to apply the AdaGuidedFilter to the input tensor, producing a filtered output based on the mean and variance of the input.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· parameter1: x - A 4D tensor of shape (N, C, H, W) representing the input image(s), where N is the batch size, C is the number of channels, H is the height, and W is the width.

**Code Description**: The forward method begins by extracting the height (H) and width (W) from the input tensor x, which is expected to have the shape (N, C, H, W). It then computes the normalization factor N by applying the box_filter function to a tensor of ones with the same spatial dimensions as x. This box_filter function is crucial as it averages pixel values over a specified radius, effectively creating a convolution operation that smooths the input tensor.

Next, a small constant epsilon (1e-2) is defined to prevent division by zero during variance calculations. The mean of the input tensor x is computed using the box_filter function, which is then divided by N to normalize it. The variance is calculated by applying the box_filter to the square of x, followed by subtracting the square of the mean_x from the result. 

The method then computes the coefficients A and b, where A is derived from the ratio of the variance to the sum of the variance and epsilon, and b is calculated as the product of (1 - A) and mean_x. The final output tensor m is computed as a combination of the input tensor x and the computed mean, modulated by the variance through the coefficients A and b. The method returns the product of the input tensor x and the computed tensor m, effectively applying the guided filtering process.

The relationship with the box_filter function is significant, as it provides the necessary mean and variance calculations that are foundational to the filtering process. The box_filter function is called multiple times within the forward method to derive these statistical measures, ensuring that the output is a refined version of the input tensor based on local pixel statistics.

**Note**: It is essential that the input tensor x is properly shaped and that the box_filter function is correctly implemented to avoid runtime errors. The method is designed to work with tensors on the same device (CPU or GPU) as the input tensor.

**Output Example**: Given an input tensor x of shape (1, 3, 4, 4), the output of the forward function will be a tensor of the same shape (1, 3, 4, 4), where each pixel value is influenced by the local mean and variance, resulting in a filtered image.

## ClassDef AdaConvGuidedFilter
**AdaConvGuidedFilter**: The function of AdaConvGuidedFilter is to apply an adaptive convolution guided filter for image processing tasks.

**attributes**: The attributes of this Class.
· esa_channels: Number of channels in the input feature map.
· n_feats: Number of features to be processed.
· conv: Convolutional layer type, default is nn.Conv2d.
· kernel_expand: Factor to expand the kernel size, default is 1.
· bias: Boolean to indicate if bias is used in convolutional layers, default is True.

**Code Description**: The AdaConvGuidedFilter class inherits from nn.Module and is designed to implement an adaptive convolution guided filter. In the constructor (__init__), it initializes several convolutional layers and pooling operations. The class takes in parameters such as esa_channels, n_feats, conv, kernel_expand, and bias to configure the filter's behavior.

The constructor first defines the number of channels (f) based on esa_channels. It then sets up a 1x1 convolutional layer (self.conv_f) to process the input features. Two additional convolutional layers are created: self.vec_conv, which applies a vertical convolution with a kernel size of (1, 17), and self.hor_conv, which applies a horizontal convolution with a kernel size of (17, 1). Both of these layers use group convolutions, allowing them to operate independently on each channel.

An adaptive average pooling layer (self.gap) is included to reduce the spatial dimensions of the feature maps to a single value per channel. This is followed by a fully connected convolutional layer (self.fc) that processes the pooled output.

In the forward method, the input tensor x is passed through the vertical and horizontal convolutional layers sequentially. The output y is squared to compute sigma, which represents the variance of the feature map. The adaptive average pooled output is processed through the fully connected layer to obtain epsilon, which acts as a regularization term.

The weight is calculated as the ratio of sigma to the sum of sigma and epsilon, allowing the filter to adaptively blend the input x with the processed output. The final output is computed by combining the input x and the weighted output m, effectively enhancing the features while preserving important details.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the input tensor x has the appropriate shape and number of channels as specified by esa_channels. The class is designed to work with 2D feature maps typically used in image processing tasks.

**Output Example**: Given an input tensor x of shape (batch_size, esa_channels, height, width), the output will be a tensor of the same shape, where the features have been enhanced through the adaptive convolution guided filtering process. For instance, if the input tensor has a shape of (1, 3, 256, 256), the output will also have a shape of (1, 3, 256, 256), but with enhanced features based on the adaptive filtering applied.
### FunctionDef __init__(self, esa_channels, n_feats, conv, kernel_expand, bias)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize an instance of the AdaConvGuidedFilter class.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· esa_channels: The number of channels in the input feature maps, which is used to define the input and output dimensions of the convolutional layers.  
· n_feats: The number of features to be processed, although it is not directly used in the initialization, it may be relevant for future operations.  
· conv: A convolutional layer function, defaulting to nn.Conv2d, which is used to create a convolutional layer for feature extraction.  
· kernel_expand: A scaling factor for the kernel size, defaulting to 1, which may be used to adjust the effective size of the convolutional kernels.  
· bias: A boolean flag indicating whether to include a bias term in the convolutional layers, defaulting to True.

**Code Description**: The __init__ function initializes the AdaConvGuidedFilter class, which is a type of guided filter that utilizes adaptive convolution. The function begins by calling the superclass constructor to ensure proper initialization of the parent class. It then sets the number of channels (f) based on the esa_channels parameter.

The function creates several convolutional layers:
1. **conv_f**: A 1x1 convolutional layer that processes the input channels. This layer is initialized using the provided convolution function (conv) and is designed to maintain the same number of input and output channels.
2. **vec_conv**: A depthwise convolutional layer with a kernel size of (1, 17) and padding that allows for the preservation of spatial dimensions. This layer operates on each channel independently, applying the convolution across the height of the feature maps.
3. **hor_conv**: Another depthwise convolutional layer with a kernel size of (17, 1) and similar padding. This layer processes the feature maps across the width, again maintaining the spatial dimensions.
4. **gap**: An adaptive average pooling layer that reduces the spatial dimensions of the feature maps to a size of 1x1, effectively summarizing the information across the spatial dimensions.
5. **fc**: A final 1x1 convolutional layer that combines the features from the previous layers, ensuring that the output has the same number of channels as the input.

The initialization process sets up the necessary layers for the AdaConvGuidedFilter to perform its intended operations on the input feature maps.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the input feature maps have the correct number of channels as specified by the esa_channels parameter. Additionally, the choice of convolution function and the configuration of the kernel_expand parameter can significantly affect the performance and output of the guided filter.

### FunctionDef forward(self, x)
**forward**: The function of forward is to apply a guided filtering operation on the input tensor.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· x: A tensor input that the guided filtering operation will be applied to.

**Code Description**: The forward function takes an input tensor `x` and processes it through a series of convolutional operations to produce a modified output. 

1. The function begins by applying a vector convolution operation to the input `x` using `self.vec_conv(x)`, which generates an intermediate tensor `y`.
2. Next, a horizontal convolution is performed on `y` with `self.hor_conv(y)`, further refining the output.
3. The variance of the output tensor is computed by squaring `y`, resulting in `sigma = torch.pow(y, 2)`.
4. An epsilon value is calculated using a fully connected layer applied to the global average pooling of `y`, represented as `epsilon = self.fc(self.gap(y))`.
5. A weight tensor is then computed using the formula `weight = sigma / (sigma + epsilon)`, which normalizes the variance with respect to epsilon.
6. The final output tensor `m` is derived by blending the input `x` and the weight tensor, calculated as `m = weight * x + (1 - weight)`.
7. The function returns the product of the input tensor `x` and the modified tensor `m`, represented as `return x * m`.

This sequence of operations effectively enhances the input tensor by applying a guided filter, which can improve the quality of the output in various applications, such as image processing.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the input tensor `x` is appropriately shaped and normalized before passing it to the forward function to achieve optimal results.

**Output Example**: If the input tensor `x` is a 2D image tensor with pixel values, the output will also be a 2D tensor where each pixel value is adjusted based on the guided filtering process, resulting in a smoothed image that retains important features.
