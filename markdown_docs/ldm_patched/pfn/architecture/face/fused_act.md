## ClassDef FusedLeakyReLUFunctionBackward
**FusedLeakyReLUFunctionBackward**: The function of FusedLeakyReLUFunctionBackward is to compute the backward pass for the fused Leaky ReLU activation function, returning gradients for the input and bias.

**attributes**: The attributes of this Class.
· ctx: A context object that stores information needed for the backward computation, including saved tensors and parameters.
· negative_slope: A parameter that defines the slope for the negative part of the Leaky ReLU function.
· scale: A scaling factor applied during the backward pass.

**Code Description**: The FusedLeakyReLUFunctionBackward class inherits from the Function class and implements two static methods: forward and backward. 

The `forward` method takes four parameters: `ctx`, `grad_output`, `out`, `negative_slope`, and `scale`. It first saves the output tensor `out` for use in the backward pass and stores the `negative_slope` and `scale` values in the context. An empty tensor is created to facilitate the computation of gradients. The method then calls `fused_act_ext.fused_bias_act`, which computes the gradient of the input based on the provided parameters. The method also calculates the gradient of the bias by summing the gradients across the appropriate dimensions. Finally, it returns the computed gradients for the input and the bias.

The `backward` method retrieves the saved output tensor from the context and computes the gradient of the output using the `fused_bias_act` function again, this time with the gradients of the input and bias. It returns the gradient of the output along with `None` for the other parameters, indicating that they do not require gradients.

This class is called by the `backward` method of the FusedLeakyReLUFunction class. In this context, the `backward` method of FusedLeakyReLUFunction invokes the `apply` method of FusedLeakyReLUFunctionBackward, passing the necessary gradients and parameters. This establishes a clear relationship where FusedLeakyReLUFunctionBackward is responsible for handling the gradient calculations during the backward pass of the fused Leaky ReLU operation.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the parameters passed to the `forward` and `backward` methods are correctly set, as they directly influence the gradient calculations. The use of the `ctx` object is crucial for maintaining the state between the forward and backward passes.

**Output Example**: A possible appearance of the code's return value from the `forward` method could be two tensors representing the gradients: `grad_input` and `grad_bias`, where `grad_input` is a tensor of the same shape as the input and `grad_bias` is a tensor representing the summed gradients for the bias.
### FunctionDef forward(ctx, grad_output, out, negative_slope, scale)
**forward**: The function of forward is to compute the gradients of the input and bias for the Fused Leaky ReLU activation function during backpropagation.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· ctx: The context object that can be used to stash information for backward computation.  
· grad_output: The gradient of the loss with respect to the output of the activation function.  
· out: The output of the activation function from the forward pass.  
· negative_slope: The negative slope parameter for the Leaky ReLU function.  
· scale: A scaling factor applied to the output.

**Code Description**: The forward function begins by saving the output tensor `out` in the context `ctx` for later use in the backward pass. It also stores the `negative_slope` and `scale` parameters in the context. An empty tensor is created with the same type as `grad_output`, which will be used as a placeholder in the subsequent computation.

The function then calls `fused_act_ext.fused_bias_act`, which is an external function that performs the fused operation of bias and activation. This function takes the `grad_output`, the empty tensor, the output from the forward pass, and additional parameters (3, 1, `negative_slope`, and `scale`) to compute the gradient with respect to the input. The result is stored in `grad_input`.

Next, the function prepares to compute the gradient of the bias. It initializes a list `dim` with the value `[0]`, which indicates that the sum will be computed over the first dimension. If `grad_input` has more than two dimensions, it extends the `dim` list to include all dimensions from 2 to the last dimension of `grad_input`.

The gradient of the bias is calculated by summing `grad_input` over the specified dimensions and detaching the result from the computation graph to prevent further gradient tracking.

Finally, the function returns a tuple containing `grad_input` and `grad_bias`, which represent the gradients of the input and bias, respectively.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the input tensors are of compatible shapes and types when using this function. The `negative_slope` and `scale` parameters should be set according to the specific requirements of the Leaky ReLU activation function.

**Output Example**: A possible appearance of the code's return value could be:
```python
(grad_input_tensor, grad_bias_tensor)
```
Where `grad_input_tensor` is a tensor representing the gradient of the input and `grad_bias_tensor` is a tensor representing the gradient of the bias.

### FunctionDef backward(ctx, gradgrad_input, gradgrad_bias)
**backward**: The function of backward is to compute the gradients for the inputs of the fused activation function during backpropagation.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· gradgrad_input: A tensor representing the gradient of the loss with respect to the output of the activation function.
· gradgrad_bias: A tensor representing the gradient of the loss with respect to the bias term.
  
**Code Description**: The backward function is designed to perform the backpropagation step for the fused activation function, specifically for the Leaky ReLU variant. It takes in two gradients: gradgrad_input, which is the gradient of the loss with respect to the output of the activation function, and gradgrad_bias, which is the gradient of the loss with respect to the bias. 

The function begins by retrieving the saved output tensor from the context (ctx) that was stored during the forward pass. This output tensor (out) is necessary for calculating the gradients. The core of the backward function involves calling the `fused_bias_act` method from the `fused_act_ext` module. This method computes the gradient of the output with respect to the input, using the provided gradients and the saved output tensor. The parameters passed to this method include gradgrad_input, gradgrad_bias, the saved output tensor (out), and additional parameters such as the negative slope and scale, which are stored in the context.

The function ultimately returns the computed gradient (gradgrad_out) for the input, along with three None values, which correspond to the gradients for the other inputs that are not used in this particular backward computation.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the context (ctx) contains the necessary saved tensors from the forward pass, as failing to do so may lead to errors during gradient computation. Additionally, the negative slope and scale parameters must be correctly set to match those used in the forward pass to ensure accurate gradient calculations.

**Output Example**: A possible return value of the backward function could be a tensor representing the computed gradient for the input, such as a tensor of shape (N, C) where N is the batch size and C is the number of channels, along with three None values indicating that there are no gradients for the other inputs. For instance, if gradgrad_out is a tensor with values [0.1, -0.2, 0.3], the return value would be (tensor([0.1, -0.2, 0.3]), None, None, None).

## ClassDef FusedLeakyReLUFunction
**FusedLeakyReLUFunction**: The function of FusedLeakyReLUFunction is to perform the forward and backward operations for the fused Leaky ReLU activation function with bias.

**attributes**: The attributes of this Class.
· ctx: A context object that is used to save information for the backward pass.
· negative_slope: A parameter that defines the slope of the negative part of the function.
· scale: A scaling factor applied to the output.

**Code Description**: The FusedLeakyReLUFunction class inherits from the Function class and implements two static methods: forward and backward. 

The forward method takes four parameters: `ctx`, `input`, `bias`, `negative_slope`, and `scale`. It initializes an empty tensor and calls the `fused_bias_act` function from the `fused_act_ext` module, which computes the fused Leaky ReLU activation with bias. The output is saved in the context for use in the backward pass, and the `negative_slope` and `scale` parameters are also stored in the context.

The backward method retrieves the saved output tensor from the context and computes the gradients for the input and bias using the `FusedLeakyReLUFunctionBackward.apply` method. It returns the gradients for the input and bias, while returning `None` for the last two parameters, which are not used in this case.

This class is called by the `fused_leaky_relu` function, which serves as a convenient wrapper. The `fused_leaky_relu` function takes the same parameters as the FusedLeakyReLUFunction and calls its apply method to perform the activation operation. This design allows for a streamlined interface for users who want to apply the fused Leaky ReLU activation in their models.

**Note**: When using this function, ensure that the input tensor and bias tensor are compatible in terms of dimensions. The `negative_slope` parameter should be set according to the desired behavior of the activation function, and the `scale` parameter can be adjusted based on the specific requirements of the model.

**Output Example**: A possible appearance of the code's return value could be a tensor representing the activated output after applying the Leaky ReLU function with the specified bias and scaling. For instance, if the input tensor is `[-1, 0, 1]` with a bias of `0.5`, a negative slope of `0.2`, and a scale of `1.414`, the output might look like `[0.5 * 0.2, 0.5, 1.5]`, resulting in `[0.1, 0.5, 1.5]`.
### FunctionDef forward(ctx, input, bias, negative_slope, scale)
**forward**: The function of forward is to compute the output of the Fused Leaky ReLU activation function with bias.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· ctx: The context object that can be used to save information for backward computation.
· input: A tensor representing the input data to the activation function.
· bias: A tensor representing the bias to be added to the input.
· negative_slope: A float value that defines the slope for the negative part of the Leaky ReLU function.
· scale: A float value that scales the output of the activation function.

**Code Description**: The forward function begins by creating an empty tensor `empty` with the same data type as the input tensor. This empty tensor is used as a placeholder in the subsequent call to the `fused_bias_act` function. The core of the function is the invocation of `fused_act_ext.fused_bias_act`, which performs the combined operations of applying the bias and the Leaky ReLU activation in a single, efficient step. The parameters passed to this function include the input tensor, the bias tensor, the empty tensor, a constant value of 3 (which may represent the activation type), a constant value of 0 (possibly indicating no additional flags), the negative slope for the Leaky ReLU, and the scale factor. After computing the output, the function saves the output tensor in the context for potential use during the backward pass. It also stores the negative slope and scale in the context for later reference. Finally, the function returns the computed output tensor.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the input and bias tensors are compatible in terms of their dimensions. The negative slope should be a non-negative value to maintain the properties of the Leaky ReLU function. The scale parameter can be used to adjust the output magnitude, and its appropriate value should be determined based on the specific use case.

**Output Example**: A possible appearance of the code's return value could be a tensor with the same shape as the input tensor, where each element has been transformed according to the Fused Leaky ReLU activation function and the bias has been added. For instance, if the input tensor is `[1.0, -2.0, 3.0]`, the output might be `[1.0 + bias, -2.0 * negative_slope + bias, 3.0 + bias]` after applying the activation and bias.
***
### FunctionDef backward(ctx, grad_output)
**backward**: The function of backward is to compute the gradients of the input and bias during the backward pass of the fused Leaky ReLU activation function.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· ctx: A context object that contains saved tensors and parameters necessary for the backward computation.  
· grad_output: A tensor representing the gradient of the output from the subsequent layer in the neural network.

**Code Description**: The `backward` method is a static method that is part of the `FusedLeakyReLUFunction` class. It is responsible for calculating the gradients required for the backward propagation of the fused Leaky ReLU activation function. The method begins by retrieving the saved output tensor `out` from the context object `ctx`, which was stored during the forward pass. This output tensor is essential for computing the gradients accurately.

The method then calls the `FusedLeakyReLUFunctionBackward.apply` method, passing in the `grad_output`, the saved output tensor `out`, and the parameters `ctx.negative_slope` and `ctx.scale`. This call is crucial as it delegates the actual gradient computation to the `FusedLeakyReLUFunctionBackward` class, which handles the intricacies of calculating the gradients for both the input and the bias.

The `backward` method returns two values: `grad_input`, which contains the gradient of the input tensor, and `grad_bias`, which contains the gradient of the bias. The method also returns `None` for the other parameters, indicating that they do not require gradients. This design ensures that only the necessary gradients are computed and returned, optimizing the backward pass.

The relationship between the `backward` method of `FusedLeakyReLUFunction` and the `FusedLeakyReLUFunctionBackward` class is integral to the functioning of the fused Leaky ReLU operation. The `backward` method serves as a bridge, facilitating the gradient calculations by invoking the `apply` method of the `FusedLeakyReLUFunctionBackward`, which encapsulates the logic for the backward pass.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the context object `ctx` is correctly populated during the forward pass, as it directly influences the gradient calculations in the backward pass. The parameters `negative_slope` and `scale` must also be accurately set to ensure the correctness of the gradient computations.

**Output Example**: A possible appearance of the code's return value from the `backward` method could be two tensors representing the gradients: `grad_input`, a tensor of the same shape as the input, and `grad_bias`, a tensor representing the summed gradients for the bias.

## ClassDef FusedLeakyReLU
**FusedLeakyReLU**: The function of FusedLeakyReLU is to apply a fused version of the Leaky ReLU activation function with learnable bias.

**attributes**: The attributes of this Class.
· channel: The number of input channels for the activation function, which determines the size of the bias parameter.  
· negative_slope: A float value that defines the slope of the function for negative input values, with a default value of 0.2.  
· scale: A scaling factor applied to the output, with a default value of √2 (approximately 1.414).  
· bias: A learnable parameter initialized to zeros, which is added to the output of the activation function.

**Code Description**: The FusedLeakyReLU class inherits from nn.Module and is designed to implement a fused Leaky ReLU activation function in a neural network. The constructor initializes the class with three parameters: `channel`, `negative_slope`, and `scale`. The `channel` parameter specifies the number of input channels, which is crucial for defining the size of the bias parameter. The `negative_slope` parameter controls the slope of the activation function for negative input values, allowing for flexibility in how the function behaves with negative inputs. The `scale` parameter is used to scale the output of the activation function, which can be beneficial for maintaining the stability of the network during training.

The `forward` method takes an input tensor and applies the `fused_leaky_relu` function, which computes the activation using the input, bias, negative slope, and scale. This method is called during the forward pass of the neural network, where the activation function is applied to the output of the previous layer.

The FusedLeakyReLU class is utilized in various components of the project, such as the ConvUpLayer and ConvLayer classes within the gfpganv1_arch.py and stylegan2_arch.py files. In these contexts, FusedLeakyReLU serves as the activation function following convolutional layers, enhancing the model's ability to learn complex patterns by introducing non-linearity. The use of a fused activation function can lead to performance improvements by reducing the number of operations and memory usage during training.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the input tensor dimensions match the expected channel size when using the FusedLeakyReLU class, as any mismatch may result in runtime errors.

**Output Example**: Given an input tensor of shape (batch_size, channel, height, width), the output of the FusedLeakyReLU activation will also be of the same shape, with the activation applied element-wise, including the learnable bias and the specified negative slope for negative inputs.
### FunctionDef __init__(self, channel, negative_slope, scale)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize the FusedLeakyReLU object with specified parameters.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· channel: An integer representing the number of input channels for the layer.  
· negative_slope: A float that defines the slope of the negative part of the Leaky ReLU activation function. Default value is 0.2.  
· scale: A float that is used to scale the output of the activation function. Default value is the square root of 2 (2**0.5).  

**Code Description**: The __init__ function is the constructor for the FusedLeakyReLU class. It is responsible for initializing the instance of the class with the necessary parameters. The function first calls the constructor of the parent class using `super().__init__()`, which ensures that any initialization defined in the parent class is also executed. 

Next, it initializes a bias parameter as a learnable parameter using `nn.Parameter(torch.zeros(channel))`. This creates a tensor of zeros with a size equal to the number of channels specified, allowing the model to learn an appropriate bias during training. The `negative_slope` parameter is stored to define the slope for the negative part of the Leaky ReLU activation function, allowing for flexibility in the activation's behavior. Finally, the `scale` parameter is stored to adjust the output of the activation function, providing further control over the activation's output characteristics.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the `channel` parameter is set correctly to match the input dimensions of the data being processed. The `negative_slope` and `scale` parameters can be adjusted based on the specific requirements of the model and the desired behavior of the activation function.

**forward**: The function of forward is to compute the output of the fused Leaky ReLU activation function applied to the input tensor.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· input: A tensor representing the input data to which the activation function will be applied.

**Code Description**: The forward method is responsible for executing the forward pass of the fused Leaky ReLU activation function. It takes a single parameter, `input`, which is a tensor containing the data that will undergo the activation transformation. The method calls the `fused_leaky_relu` function, passing the input tensor along with additional attributes of the class, namely `self.bias`, `self.negative_slope`, and `self.scale`. 

The `fused_leaky_relu` function is a higher-level abstraction that applies the fused Leaky ReLU operation, which combines the activation function with optional bias addition and scaling. This function is designed to optimize performance by reducing the number of separate operations required to compute the activation, thus improving efficiency during model training and inference.

The `fused_leaky_relu` function internally utilizes the `FusedLeakyReLUFunction` class, which handles both the forward and backward computations for the activation function. This design allows for seamless integration of the activation function within neural network architectures, ensuring that the output is computed correctly while maintaining compatibility with gradient calculations during backpropagation.

This method is typically invoked in the context of neural network layers where the activation function is required after a linear transformation of the input data. It is essential for developers to ensure that the input tensor is appropriately shaped and that the parameters for bias, negative slope, and scale are set according to the specific requirements of the model.

**Note**: When using this function, it is crucial to ensure that the input tensor is compatible with the bias tensor in terms of dimensions. The `negative_slope` parameter should be chosen based on the desired characteristics of the Leaky ReLU activation, and the `scale` parameter can be adjusted to meet the scaling needs of the output.

**Output Example**: A possible appearance of the code's return value could be a tensor representing the activated output after applying the Leaky ReLU function with the specified bias and scaling. For instance, if the input tensor is `[-1, 0, 1]` with a bias of `0.5`, a negative slope of `0.2`, and a scale of `1.414`, the output might look like `[0.1, 0.5, 1.5]`.

The function calls the `apply` method of the FusedLeakyReLUFunction class, which performs the actual computation of the fused Leaky ReLU activation.

The FusedLeakyReLUFunction class is designed to handle both the forward and backward passes of the activation function. In the forward method, it utilizes the `fused_bias_act` function from the `fused_act_ext` module to compute the activation while incorporating the bias. The output is saved in the context for use during the backward pass, where gradients are computed for the input and bias.

This function is called in various parts of the project, including the forward methods of classes such as FusedLeakyReLU and EqualLinear.
