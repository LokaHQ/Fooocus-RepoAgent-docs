## ClassDef NoiseScheduleVP
**NoiseScheduleVP**: The function of NoiseScheduleVP is to create a wrapper class for the forward Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE) of the Variational Posterior (VP) type, supporting both discrete-time and continuous-time diffusion models.

**attributes**: The attributes of this Class.
· schedule: A string indicating the noise schedule type, which can be 'discrete', 'linear', or 'cosine'.
· betas: A tensor representing the beta array for discrete-time diffusion models.
· alphas_cumprod: A tensor representing the cumulative product of alphas for discrete-time diffusion models.
· continuous_beta_0: A float representing the smallest beta for the linear schedule in continuous-time diffusion models.
· continuous_beta_1: A float representing the largest beta for the linear schedule in continuous-time diffusion models.
· total_N: An integer representing the total number of discrete steps.
· T: A float representing the ending time of the forward process.
· t_array: A tensor containing the time steps for interpolation.
· log_alpha_array: A tensor containing the logarithm of alpha values for the discrete schedule.

**Code Description**: The NoiseScheduleVP class is designed to handle the forward SDE for both discrete and continuous-time diffusion models. In the constructor, the class initializes various parameters based on the specified noise schedule. If the schedule is 'discrete', it calculates the logarithm of alpha values using either the provided betas or alphas_cumprod. The total number of steps and the time array are also computed. For continuous-time schedules, default values for beta parameters and the cosine schedule are set. The class provides methods to compute various quantities such as alpha_t, sigma_t, and lambda_t based on the time input t. The marginal_log_mean_coeff method computes log(alpha_t) for a given time, while marginal_alpha and marginal_std compute alpha_t and sigma_t, respectively. The marginal_lambda method computes the half-logSNR, and the inverse_lambda method allows for the computation of the continuous-time label t from a given half-logSNR value.

**Note**: When using this class, it is important to ensure that either the betas or alphas_cumprod is provided for discrete-time models, as both are not required simultaneously. Additionally, the choice of schedule must be carefully considered, as it affects the calculations performed within the class.

**Output Example**: An example of creating an instance of NoiseScheduleVP for a discrete-time diffusion model with a given betas tensor might look like this:
```python
ns = NoiseScheduleVP('discrete', betas=betas_tensor)
```
This would initialize the NoiseScheduleVP object with the specified beta values, allowing for subsequent calculations related to the forward SDE.
### FunctionDef __init__(self, schedule, betas, alphas_cumprod, continuous_beta_0, continuous_beta_1)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize a wrapper class for the forward Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE) of the Variational Posterior (VP) type.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· schedule: A `str` that specifies the noise schedule of the forward SDE. Acceptable values are 'discrete' for discrete-time DPMs, and 'linear' or 'cosine' for continuous-time DPMs.
· betas: A `torch.Tensor` that represents the beta array for the discrete-time DPM. This parameter is optional.
· alphas_cumprod: A `torch.Tensor` that holds the cumulative product of alphas for the discrete-time DPM. This parameter is optional, and either `betas` or `alphas_cumprod` must be provided.
· continuous_beta_0: A `float` that sets the smallest beta for the linear schedule in continuous-time DPMs. The default value is 0.1.
· continuous_beta_1: A `float` that sets the largest beta for the linear schedule in continuous-time DPMs. The default value is 20.0.

**Code Description**: The __init__ function is designed to create an instance of a class that models the forward SDE for diffusion processes. It supports both discrete-time and continuous-time diffusion models. 

When the `schedule` parameter is set to 'discrete', the function calculates the logarithm of alphas using either the provided `betas` or `alphas_cumprod`. It computes the cumulative sum of the logarithm of (1 - betas) to derive `log_alphas`, which is then reshaped for further processing. The total number of discrete steps, `total_N`, is determined based on the length of `log_alphas`, and a time array `t_array` is generated to represent the discrete time steps.

For continuous-time DPMs, the function initializes parameters for the linear and cosine schedules. It sets default values for `beta_0`, `beta_1`, and other hyperparameters relevant to the cosine schedule. The function also addresses potential numerical issues by adjusting the ending time `T` for the cosine schedule.

The function raises a ValueError if an unsupported noise schedule is provided, ensuring that only valid schedules are accepted.

**Note**: It is crucial to provide either the `betas` or `alphas_cumprod` when using the discrete-time DPMs. The `alphas_cumprod` corresponds to the \hat{alpha_n} arrays in the DDPM notation, which differs from the alpha_t notation used in the DPM-Solver. Users should be aware of these distinctions to avoid confusion when implementing the model.

### FunctionDef marginal_log_mean_coeff(self, t)
**marginal_log_mean_coeff**: The function of marginal_log_mean_coeff is to compute log(alpha_t) of a given continuous-time label t in the interval [0, T].

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· t: A PyTorch tensor representing the continuous-time label, which must be in the range [0, T].

**Code Description**: The marginal_log_mean_coeff function calculates the logarithm of the alpha coefficient (log(alpha_t)) for a specified continuous-time label t based on the defined scheduling method. The function supports three different scheduling strategies: 'discrete', 'linear', and 'cosine'.

1. If the scheduling method is 'discrete', the function utilizes the interpolate_fn to perform piecewise linear interpolation. It reshapes the input tensor t and computes log(alpha_t) using pre-defined arrays (self.t_array and self.log_alpha_array) that are transferred to the appropriate device (CPU or GPU) for computation.

2. If the scheduling method is 'linear', the function computes log(alpha_t) using a quadratic formula that incorporates the parameters self.beta_1 and self.beta_0. The formula used is:
   - log(alpha_t) = -0.25 * t^2 * (self.beta_1 - self.beta_0) - 0.5 * t * self.beta_0

3. If the scheduling method is 'cosine', the function defines a lambda function log_alpha_fn that computes the logarithm of the cosine function. It applies this function to the input t, adjusting for a cosine scaling factor (self.cosine_s) and subtracting a constant (self.cosine_log_alpha_0) to yield log(alpha_t).

The marginal_log_mean_coeff function is called by several other methods within the NoiseScheduleVP class, including marginal_alpha, marginal_std, and marginal_lambda. Each of these methods relies on the output of marginal_log_mean_coeff to compute their respective values:

- The marginal_alpha method computes alpha_t by exponentiating the result of marginal_log_mean_coeff.
- The marginal_std method calculates sigma_t by taking the square root of the expression derived from marginal_log_mean_coeff.
- The marginal_lambda method computes lambda_t by combining the results from marginal_log_mean_coeff and the logarithm of sigma_t.

This interdependence highlights the critical role of marginal_log_mean_coeff in the overall computation of noise scheduling parameters.

**Note**: When using this function, ensure that the input tensor t is appropriately shaped and falls within the specified range [0, T]. The function's behavior is contingent upon the defined scheduling method, so it is essential to set the schedule attribute correctly before invoking this method.

**Output Example**: Given an input tensor t of shape [2] with values [0.5, 1.5], the output could be a tensor containing the computed log(alpha_t) values corresponding to these inputs, such as [-0.693, -1.386].
***
### FunctionDef marginal_alpha(self, t)
**marginal_alpha**: The function of marginal_alpha is to compute alpha_t of a given continuous-time label t in the interval [0, T].

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· t: A PyTorch tensor representing the continuous-time label, which must be in the range [0, T].

**Code Description**: The marginal_alpha function is designed to calculate the alpha coefficient (alpha_t) for a specified continuous-time label t. It achieves this by exponentiating the result obtained from the marginal_log_mean_coeff function, which computes the logarithm of alpha_t (log(alpha_t)). The marginal_log_mean_coeff function is integral to the noise scheduling process, as it determines the value of log(alpha_t) based on the defined scheduling method, which can be 'discrete', 'linear', or 'cosine'.

When marginal_alpha is invoked, it first calls marginal_log_mean_coeff with the provided tensor t. The output of this call is then exponentiated using the torch.exp function to yield the final alpha_t value. This relationship highlights the dependency of marginal_alpha on marginal_log_mean_coeff, as the latter provides the necessary logarithmic value that is transformed into the alpha coefficient.

The marginal_alpha function is typically used in conjunction with other methods within the NoiseScheduleVP class, such as marginal_std and marginal_lambda, which rely on the computed alpha_t value for their respective calculations. This interdependence emphasizes the importance of correctly implementing the marginal_log_mean_coeff function, as it directly influences the output of marginal_alpha.

**Note**: When using this function, ensure that the input tensor t is appropriately shaped and falls within the specified range [0, T]. The accuracy of the output is contingent upon the correct configuration of the scheduling method in the NoiseScheduleVP class.

**Output Example**: Given an input tensor t of shape [2] with values [0.5, 1.5], the output could be a tensor containing the computed alpha_t values corresponding to these inputs, such as [0.707, 0.223].
***
### FunctionDef marginal_std(self, t)
**marginal_std**: The function of marginal_std is to compute the standard deviation sigma_t for a given continuous-time label t within the interval [0, T].

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· t: A PyTorch tensor representing the continuous-time label, which must be in the range [0, T].

**Code Description**: The marginal_std function calculates the standard deviation sigma_t by taking the square root of the expression derived from the marginal_log_mean_coeff function. Specifically, it computes sigma_t as follows:

1. The function first calls marginal_log_mean_coeff(t) to obtain the logarithm of the alpha coefficient (log(alpha_t)) for the specified continuous-time label t. This function is crucial as it determines the behavior of the marginal_std function based on the defined scheduling method.

2. The expression used in marginal_std is derived from the relationship between sigma_t and log(alpha_t). The formula applied is:
   - sigma_t = sqrt(1 - exp(2 * log(alpha_t)))
   This transformation is essential for converting the logarithmic representation of alpha_t into a standard deviation measure.

3. The output of marginal_std is a tensor that represents the computed standard deviation values corresponding to the input tensor t.

The marginal_std function is interdependent with the marginal_log_mean_coeff function, which means that any changes in the scheduling method or the parameters used in marginal_log_mean_coeff will directly affect the output of marginal_std. This relationship highlights the importance of ensuring that the scheduling method is correctly set before invoking marginal_std, as it relies on the accurate computation of log(alpha_t) to produce valid results.

**Note**: When using this function, ensure that the input tensor t is appropriately shaped and falls within the specified range [0, T]. The function's output will vary based on the scheduling method defined in the NoiseScheduleVP class.

**Output Example**: Given an input tensor t of shape [2] with values [0.5, 1.5], the output could be a tensor containing the computed standard deviation values corresponding to these inputs, such as [0.707, 0.577].
***
### FunctionDef marginal_lambda(self, t)
**marginal_lambda**: The function of marginal_lambda is to compute lambda_t = log(alpha_t) - log(sigma_t) for a given continuous-time label t in the interval [0, T].

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· t: A PyTorch tensor representing the continuous-time label, which must be in the range [0, T].

**Code Description**: The marginal_lambda function is designed to calculate the value of lambda_t, which is a key component in the noise scheduling process. This function first invokes the marginal_log_mean_coeff method to compute log(alpha_t), which represents the logarithm of the alpha coefficient associated with the continuous-time label t. The computed log(alpha_t) is stored in the variable log_mean_coeff.

Next, the function calculates log(sigma_t) using the formula log_std = 0.5 * torch.log(1. - torch.exp(2. * log_mean_coeff). This formula derives from the relationship between alpha and sigma in the context of noise scheduling, where sigma_t is related to the standard deviation of the noise.

Finally, the function returns the result of the expression log_mean_coeff - log_std, which yields the desired value of lambda_t. This computation is crucial for various applications in generative modeling and diffusion processes, where understanding the relationship between alpha and sigma is essential for effective noise management.

The marginal_lambda function relies on the output of the marginal_log_mean_coeff function, which is responsible for calculating log(alpha_t). The interdependence of these functions highlights the importance of marginal_log_mean_coeff in the overall computation of noise scheduling parameters. The marginal_lambda function is typically called in scenarios where the noise characteristics need to be evaluated based on the continuous-time label t.

**Note**: When using this function, ensure that the input tensor t is appropriately shaped and falls within the specified range [0, T]. The accuracy of the computed lambda_t is contingent upon the correct implementation of the marginal_log_mean_coeff function, so it is essential to verify that this function operates as expected before relying on the output of marginal_lambda.

**Output Example**: Given an input tensor t of shape [2] with values [0.5, 1.5], the output could be a tensor containing the computed lambda_t values corresponding to these inputs, such as [-0.693, -1.386].
***
### FunctionDef inverse_lambda(self, lamb)
**inverse_lambda**: The function of inverse_lambda is to compute the continuous-time label t in [0, T] of a given half-logSNR lambda_t.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· lamb: A PyTorch tensor representing the half-logSNR value for which the continuous-time label t is to be computed.

**Code Description**: The inverse_lambda function is designed to compute the continuous-time label t based on the input half-logSNR value, lamb. The computation varies depending on the scheduling method specified by the object's attribute self.schedule.

If the scheduling method is 'linear', the function calculates a temporary variable tmp using the formula that involves the beta parameters (self.beta_0 and self.beta_1). It computes Delta, which is a combination of self.beta_0 squared and tmp. The final output is derived from tmp normalized by the square root of Delta added to self.beta_0, divided by the difference between self.beta_1 and self.beta_0.

In the case where the scheduling method is 'discrete', the function first computes log_alpha, which is derived from lamb. It then calls the interpolate_fn function, passing log_alpha along with the flipped log_alpha_array and t_array. This interpolation function is crucial for obtaining the continuous-time label t from the log_alpha values, and it ensures that the interpolation is performed in a differentiable manner suitable for use in automatic differentiation frameworks like PyTorch.

For other scheduling methods, the function computes log_alpha similarly to the discrete case and defines a lambda function t_fn that calculates t using the arccosine function applied to the exponential of log_alpha adjusted by self.cosine_log_alpha_0. The result is then scaled and shifted based on self.cosine_s.

The inverse_lambda function is integral to the NoiseScheduleVP class, as it provides the necessary continuous-time labels for various computations involved in the noise scheduling process. It leverages the interpolate_fn function to facilitate the interpolation of values, which is essential for accurate calculations in scenarios where the scheduling method is discrete.

**Note**: When using this function, ensure that the input tensor lamb is appropriately shaped and that the scheduling method is correctly set to either 'linear' or 'discrete' to obtain valid results.

**Output Example**: Given an input tensor lamb of shape [1], a possible output could be a tensor of shape [1] containing the computed continuous-time label t. For example, if lamb = [[-1.0]], the output might look like [[0.5]].
***
## FunctionDef model_wrapper(model, noise_schedule, model_type, model_kwargs, guidance_type, condition, unconditional_condition, guidance_scale, classifier_fn, classifier_kwargs)
**model_wrapper**: The function of model_wrapper is to create a wrapper function for the noise prediction model used in diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs).

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· model: A diffusion model with the corresponding format described in the documentation.
· noise_schedule: A noise schedule object, such as NoiseScheduleVP.
· model_type: A string indicating the parameterization type of the diffusion model, which can be "noise", "x_start", "v", or "score".
· model_kwargs: A dictionary for additional inputs to the model function.
· guidance_type: A string specifying the type of guidance for sampling, which can be "uncond", "classifier", or "classifier-free".
· condition: A PyTorch tensor representing the condition for guided sampling, applicable for "classifier" or "classifier-free" guidance types.
· unconditional_condition: A PyTorch tensor representing the condition for unconditional sampling, used for "classifier-free" guidance type.
· guidance_scale: A float that scales the guided sampling.
· classifier_fn: A classifier function, applicable only for classifier guidance.
· classifier_kwargs: A dictionary for additional inputs to the classifier function.

**Code Description**: The model_wrapper function is designed to facilitate the use of diffusion models in a continuous-time framework by wrapping the model function to accept continuous time as input. It supports various types of diffusion models, including noise prediction, data prediction, velocity prediction, and score functions, which are determined by the model_type parameter. The function also allows for different sampling guidance methods, such as unconditional sampling, classifier guidance, and classifier-free guidance, controlled by the guidance_type parameter.

The function first defines an inner function, get_model_input_time, which converts continuous-time labels into the appropriate input format for the model based on the noise schedule. Another inner function, noise_pred_fn, computes the predicted noise based on the model type and the noise schedule. The cond_grad_fn inner function calculates the gradient of the classifier, which is essential for classifier guidance. Finally, the model_fn inner function serves as the main interface for the DPM-Solver, determining how to process inputs based on the specified guidance type.

The model_wrapper function is called within the sample_unipc function, where it wraps a model function that predicts noise given an input image and a noise schedule. This integration allows for the generation of images using the DPM-Solver, leveraging the capabilities of the wrapped model to produce high-quality outputs based on the specified parameters and guidance methods.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the model_type and guidance_type parameters are set correctly, as they dictate the behavior of the wrapped model function. Additionally, users should be aware of the expected formats for the model and classifier functions to avoid runtime errors.

**Output Example**: A possible appearance of the code's return value could be a callable function that takes in a noised image and continuous time input, returning the predicted noise based on the specified model and guidance settings. For instance, calling the returned function with an input image and a continuous time value might yield a tensor representing the predicted noise for that input.
### FunctionDef get_model_input_time(t_continuous)
**get_model_input_time**: The function of get_model_input_time is to convert continuous-time input into model input time based on the noise schedule type.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· t_continuous: A continuous-time value that needs to be converted. It is expected to be within the range [epsilon, T] for discrete-time DPMs or used directly for continuous-time DPMs.

**Code Description**: The get_model_input_time function is designed to handle the conversion of a continuous-time input, t_continuous, into a format suitable for model input based on the type of noise schedule being utilized. If the noise schedule is set to 'discrete', the function applies a transformation that scales the continuous time from the range [1 / N, 1] to a new range [0, 1000 * (N - 1) / N]. This transformation is achieved by subtracting the value of 1 / noise_schedule.total_N from t_continuous and then multiplying the result by 1000. In contrast, if the noise schedule is not 'discrete', the function simply returns the t_continuous value unchanged, indicating that it is already in the appropriate format for continuous-time DPMs.

The function is called by two other functions within the project: noise_pred_fn and model_fn. In noise_pred_fn, get_model_input_time is invoked to convert t_continuous before it is used as input for the model. This ensures that the model receives the correctly scaled time input, which is crucial for accurate predictions. Similarly, in model_fn, get_model_input_time is called to prepare the t_continuous value for further processing, particularly when the guidance type is "classifier". The output from get_model_input_time is then utilized to compute conditional gradients and noise predictions, thereby playing a critical role in the overall noise prediction process.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the input t_continuous is within the expected range to avoid unexpected behavior or errors during the conversion process.

**Output Example**: For a discrete noise schedule with total_N = 10 and t_continuous = 0.8, the function would return (0.8 - 1 / 10) * 1000 = 700.0. If the noise schedule is continuous, the output would simply be 0.8.
***
### FunctionDef noise_pred_fn(x, t_continuous, cond)
**noise_pred_fn**: The function of noise_pred_fn is to predict noise based on the input tensor and continuous time variable, optionally conditioned on additional inputs.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· x: A PyTorch tensor representing the input data for which noise needs to be predicted.
· t_continuous: A tensor representing the continuous time variable, which is used to determine the noise prediction context.
· cond: An optional parameter that can be used to provide additional conditioning information for the noise prediction.

**Code Description**: The noise_pred_fn function is designed to predict noise in a model based on the input tensor `x` and a continuous time variable `t_continuous`. The function begins by checking if `t_continuous` is a single value; if so, it expands it to match the batch size of `x`. It then calls the helper function get_model_input_time to convert `t_continuous` into a suitable format for model input.

The output of the model is computed by invoking the model with the input tensor `x` and the processed time input `t_input`. The behavior of the function varies based on the `model_type`:

1. If `model_type` is "noise", the function directly returns the model output.
2. If `model_type` is "x_start", it computes the alpha and sigma values using the noise_schedule's marginal_alpha and marginal_std functions, respectively. The output is adjusted to reconstruct the original data from the predicted noise.
3. If `model_type` is "v", it similarly computes alpha and sigma values and returns a combination of the model output and the input tensor `x`, effectively blending the predicted noise with the original input.
4. If `model_type` is "score", the function computes the sigma value and returns the negative product of sigma and the model output, which is used for score-based generative modeling.

The noise_pred_fn function is called by the model_fn function, which serves as the main interface for noise prediction in the DPM-Solver context. Depending on the guidance type specified in model_fn, noise_pred_fn may be called with or without conditioning information. This relationship highlights the role of noise_pred_fn in the overall noise prediction process, as it provides the necessary predictions that are further processed based on the guidance type.

**Note**: It is crucial to ensure that the input tensors `x` and `t_continuous` are appropriately shaped and that the `model_type` is correctly specified to avoid any computational errors during the noise prediction process.

**Output Example**: For an input tensor `x` with shape [batch_size, channels, height, width] and a corresponding `t_continuous` value, the function might return a tensor of the same shape representing the predicted noise, which could look like a tensor filled with values that reflect the noise characteristics based on the model's learned parameters.
***
### FunctionDef cond_grad_fn(x, t_input)
**cond_grad_fn**: The function of cond_grad_fn is to compute the gradient of the classifier, specifically nabla_{x} log p_t(cond | x_t).

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· x: A tensor representing the input data for which the gradient is to be computed. It is expected to have gradients enabled.
· t_input: A tensor that serves as the input time variable for the classifier function, which is used to condition the output.

**Code Description**: The cond_grad_fn function is designed to compute the gradient of the log probability of a condition given an input, which is essential in various machine learning tasks, particularly in the context of classifier guidance in generative models. The function begins by enabling gradient computation using `torch.enable_grad()`, which allows for the calculation of gradients with respect to the input tensor x.

The input tensor x is detached from the current computation graph and marked to require gradients by calling `detach().requires_grad_(True)`. This is crucial as it ensures that the gradients can be computed without affecting the original tensor's gradient tracking.

Next, the function calls a classifier function, classifier_fn, passing in the modified input tensor x_in and the time input t_input along with any additional keyword arguments specified in classifier_kwargs. The output of this classifier function is a log probability, which is then summed to prepare for gradient computation.

Finally, the function utilizes `torch.autograd.grad` to compute the gradient of the summed log probability with respect to the input tensor x_in. The function returns the computed gradient, which is essential for guiding the model during training or inference.

This function is called within the model_fn function, which serves as a noise prediction model function used for DPM-Solver. In model_fn, the guidance type is checked, and if it is set to "classifier", the cond_grad_fn is invoked to obtain the conditional gradient. This gradient is then used to adjust the noise prediction based on the guidance scale and the marginal standard deviation from the noise schedule. Thus, cond_grad_fn plays a critical role in enhancing the model's performance by providing necessary gradient information for classifier-based guidance.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the input tensor x is appropriately shaped and that the classifier_fn is defined and accessible within the scope where cond_grad_fn is called.

**Output Example**: A possible return value of cond_grad_fn could be a tensor representing the computed gradient, which might look like:
```
tensor([[0.1, -0.2, 0.3],
        [0.0, 0.5, -0.1]])
```
***
### FunctionDef model_fn(x, t_continuous)
**model_fn**: The function of model_fn is to serve as the noise prediction model function used for DPM-Solver.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· x: A PyTorch tensor representing the input data for which noise predictions are to be made.
· t_continuous: A tensor representing the continuous time variable, which is used to determine the context for noise prediction.

**Code Description**: The model_fn function is designed to predict noise based on the input tensor `x` and the continuous time variable `t_continuous`. The function begins by checking the shape of `t_continuous`. If it contains only a single value, it expands this value to match the batch size of `x`, ensuring that the dimensions are compatible for subsequent operations.

The function then evaluates the `guidance_type`, which determines how the noise prediction is computed. There are three possible guidance types: "uncond", "classifier", and "classifier-free".

1. If the guidance type is "uncond", the function directly calls the noise prediction function `noise_pred_fn`, passing in `x` and `t_continuous`. This results in a straightforward noise prediction without any conditioning.

2. If the guidance type is "classifier", the function first asserts that the `classifier_fn` is defined. It then prepares the input time for the model by calling `get_model_input_time(t_continuous)`. The conditional gradient is computed using `cond_grad_fn`, which requires the input tensor `x` and the processed time input `t_input`. The function also retrieves the marginal standard deviation for the given `t_continuous` using `noise_schedule.marginal_std(t_continuous)`. The noise prediction is obtained from `noise_pred_fn`, and the final output is adjusted by subtracting a scaled version of the conditional gradient, which is influenced by the `guidance_scale`.

3. If the guidance type is "classifier-free", the function checks if the `guidance_scale` is equal to 1 or if `unconditional_condition` is None. If either condition is met, it calls `noise_pred_fn` with `x`, `t_continuous`, and an optional condition. Otherwise, it concatenates `x`, `t_continuous`, and the conditions to create inputs for `noise_pred_fn`. The output from this function is then processed to combine the unconditional and conditional noise predictions based on the `guidance_scale`.

The model_fn function plays a critical role in the overall noise prediction process, as it orchestrates the flow of data through various functions, ensuring that the predictions are made according to the specified guidance type. It relies heavily on the helper functions `noise_pred_fn`, `get_model_input_time`, and `cond_grad_fn`, which provide the necessary computations for noise prediction and gradient calculations.

**Note**: It is essential to ensure that the input tensor `x` and the continuous time tensor `t_continuous` are appropriately shaped. Additionally, the `guidance_type` must be correctly specified to avoid any computational errors during the noise prediction process.

**Output Example**: For an input tensor `x` with shape [batch_size, channels, height, width] and a corresponding `t_continuous` value, the function might return a tensor of the same shape representing the predicted noise, which could look like a tensor filled with values that reflect the noise characteristics based on the model's learned parameters.

### FunctionDef dynamic_thresholding_fn(self, x0, t)
**dynamic_thresholding_fn**: The function of dynamic_thresholding_fn is to apply dynamic thresholding to a given tensor, normalizing its values based on a calculated threshold.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· x0: A PyTorch tensor that represents the input data to be thresholded. It can have multiple dimensions.
· t: An optional parameter that is not utilized within the function but may be included for compatibility with other methods or for future extensions.

**Code Description**: The dynamic_thresholding_fn method performs dynamic thresholding on the input tensor x0. It begins by determining the number of dimensions of the input tensor using the dim() method. The dynamic thresholding ratio, defined as self.dynamic_thresholding_ratio, is then used to compute a threshold value for each sample in the batch. This is achieved by calculating the quantile of the absolute values of x0, reshaped to have a shape of (batch_size, -1), which allows for the computation of the quantile along the specified dimension (dim=1).

The computed threshold values are stored in the tensor s. To ensure that these values do not fall below a predefined maximum threshold, self.thresholding_max_val, the function uses the maximum operation between s and a tensor filled with self.thresholding_max_val, expanded to match the dimensions of s using the expand_dims function. This ensures that the thresholding is consistent across all dimensions of the input tensor.

Next, the function clamps the values of x0 to be within the range defined by -s and s, effectively normalizing the input tensor. The final step involves dividing the clamped tensor by s, resulting in a normalized output tensor that is returned.

The expand_dims function, which is called within this method, plays a crucial role in ensuring that the threshold values are appropriately shaped for the operations performed. By expanding the dimensions of the tensor s, it allows for element-wise operations to be conducted seamlessly across the input tensor x0.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the input tensor x0 is properly formatted and that the dynamic thresholding ratio and maximum threshold values are set appropriately to achieve the desired normalization effect.

**Output Example**: For an input tensor x0 with shape [4, 3, 32, 32] and a dynamic thresholding ratio of 0.5, the output might be a tensor with the same shape [4, 3, 32, 32], where the values have been normalized based on the calculated thresholds.

### FunctionDef noise_prediction_fn(self, x, t)
**noise_prediction_fn**: The function of noise_prediction_fn is to return the noise prediction model based on the input data and time step.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· parameter1: x - The input data tensor for which noise prediction is to be computed.
· parameter2: t - The time step at which the noise prediction is evaluated.

**Code Description**: The noise_prediction_fn method is designed to compute the noise prediction from a model based on the provided input tensor x and the time step t. It first checks if a noise mask is defined. If the noise mask is not None, the function multiplies the output of the model by this noise mask, effectively applying a selective filtering to the noise prediction. If the noise mask is None, it simply returns the output of the model without any modifications. This function is crucial in scenarios where noise needs to be predicted in a controlled manner, allowing for flexibility in how the model's predictions are utilized.

The noise_prediction_fn function is called by two other functions within the same class: data_prediction_fn and model_fn. In data_prediction_fn, the noise prediction is computed first and then used to adjust the input data tensor x based on the noise schedule parameters alpha_t and sigma_t. This adjustment is essential for obtaining a refined estimate of the original data (x0) while considering the noise present in the input. In model_fn, the noise_prediction_fn is called conditionally based on the predict_x0 flag. If predict_x0 is set to True, the function will return the data prediction instead; otherwise, it will return the noise prediction. This indicates that noise_prediction_fn plays a pivotal role in determining the behavior of the model based on the prediction mode.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the noise_mask is properly initialized before calling this function to avoid unintended behavior. The function assumes that the model has been defined and is capable of processing the input tensor x along with the time step t.

**Output Example**: A possible output of the noise_prediction_fn could be a tensor representing the predicted noise, which may look like this: 
```
tensor([[0.1, -0.2, 0.3],
        [0.0, 0.5, -0.1]])
``` 
This output would vary depending on the input data x, the time step t, and the internal state of the model.
***
### FunctionDef data_prediction_fn(self, x, t)
**data_prediction_fn**: The function of data_prediction_fn is to return the data prediction model with thresholding applied.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· parameter1: x - The input data tensor for which the data prediction is to be computed.
· parameter2: t - The time step at which the data prediction is evaluated.

**Code Description**: The data_prediction_fn method is designed to compute a refined estimate of the original data (denoted as x0) based on the input tensor x and the time step t. The function begins by invoking the noise_prediction_fn to obtain a noise prediction, which is essential for adjusting the input data. The noise prediction is computed using the provided input tensor x and the time step t, allowing the model to account for the noise present in the input data.

Next, the method retrieves the marginal alpha (alpha_t) and marginal standard deviation (sigma_t) values from the noise schedule using the time step t. These values are crucial for normalizing the input data tensor x. The computation of x0 is performed by adjusting x with the noise prediction and scaling it according to alpha_t and sigma_t. This step ensures that the output reflects a more accurate representation of the original data.

If the thresholding feature is enabled (indicated by self.thresholding), the function applies a thresholding mechanism to x0. This involves calculating a quantile of the absolute values of x0 and clamping the values of x0 within a range defined by this quantile. The thresholding process helps to mitigate extreme values and maintain the integrity of the data prediction.

Additionally, if a noise mask is defined (self.noise_mask is not None), the function combines the adjusted x0 with a masked image, allowing for selective filtering based on the noise mask. This step is particularly useful in scenarios where certain regions of the input data should be emphasized or suppressed during the prediction process.

The data_prediction_fn is called by two other functions within the same class: model_fn and denoise_to_zero_fn. In model_fn, the function is invoked when the predict_x0 flag is set to True, indicating that the model should return the data prediction instead of the noise prediction. In denoise_to_zero_fn, the function is called to perform denoising at the final step, effectively solving the ordinary differential equation (ODE) from a specified time step to infinity.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the noise_mask is properly initialized and that the thresholding feature is configured as intended before calling this function to avoid unintended behavior. The function assumes that the model has been defined and is capable of processing the input tensor x along with the time step t.

**Output Example**: A possible output of the data_prediction_fn could be a tensor representing the predicted data, which may look like this: 
```
tensor([[0.5, -0.3, 0.2],
        [0.1, 0.4, -0.2]])
``` 
This output would vary depending on the input data x, the time step t, and the internal state of the model.
***
### FunctionDef model_fn(self, x, t)
**model_fn**: The function of model_fn is to convert the model to either the noise prediction model or the data prediction model based on a specified condition.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· parameter1: x - The input data tensor for which the prediction is to be computed.
· parameter2: t - The time step at which the prediction is evaluated.

**Code Description**: The model_fn method is designed to determine the type of prediction to be made by the model based on the value of the attribute self.predict_x0. If self.predict_x0 is set to True, the function calls the data_prediction_fn method, which computes a refined estimate of the original data (x0) by adjusting the input tensor x based on noise predictions and other parameters. This process involves utilizing the noise schedule to normalize the input data and potentially applying thresholding to mitigate extreme values.

Conversely, if self.predict_x0 is set to False, the model_fn invokes the noise_prediction_fn method. This method is responsible for returning the noise prediction model based on the input data tensor x and the time step t. The noise_prediction_fn computes the noise prediction while considering any defined noise mask, allowing for selective filtering of the output.

The model_fn serves as a crucial decision point in the workflow of the model, directing the flow to either the data prediction or noise prediction based on the current prediction mode. It is called by other functions within the same class, such as multistep_uni_pc_vary_update and multistep_uni_pc_bh_update, which implement different update strategies for the model. These functions rely on model_fn to obtain the appropriate predictions during their execution, thereby influencing the overall behavior of the model during the multistep update processes.

**Note**: It is essential to ensure that the model is properly initialized and that the predict_x0 attribute is set according to the desired prediction mode before invoking this function. This will prevent unintended behavior and ensure that the correct prediction type is returned.

**Output Example**: A possible output of the model_fn could be a tensor representing either the predicted data or the predicted noise, depending on the state of self.predict_x0. For instance, if self.predict_x0 is True, the output might look like this:
```
tensor([[0.5, -0.3, 0.2],
        [0.1, 0.4, -0.2]])
```
If self.predict_x0 is False, the output could resemble:
```
tensor([[0.1, -0.2, 0.3],
        [0.0, 0.5, -0.1]])
``` 
The actual output will vary based on the input data x, the time step t, and the internal state of the model.

### FunctionDef get_time_steps(self, skip_type, t_T, t_0, N, device)
**get_time_steps**: The function of get_time_steps is to compute the intermediate time steps for sampling based on a specified skip type.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· skip_type: A string indicating the method for generating time steps. It can be 'logSNR', 'time_uniform', or 'time_quadratic'.
· t_T: A float representing the starting time point for the time steps.
· t_0: A float representing the ending time point for the time steps.
· N: An integer specifying the number of intermediate time steps to compute.
· device: A string or object indicating the device (e.g., CPU or GPU) on which the computations will be performed.

**Code Description**: The get_time_steps function generates a series of time steps between two specified points, t_T and t_0, based on the chosen skip type. The function supports three methods for generating these time steps:

1. **logSNR**: When the skip_type is 'logSNR', the function calculates the lambda values at t_T and t_0 using the marginal_lambda method from the noise_schedule object. It then generates a linear space of logSNR steps between these two lambda values and returns the inverse lambda values corresponding to these steps.

2. **time_uniform**: If the skip_type is 'time_uniform', the function simply returns a linear space of time steps between t_T and t_0, evenly distributing N + 1 points.

3. **time_quadratic**: For the 'time_quadratic' skip_type, the function computes time steps using a quadratic transformation. It first generates a linear space of points between t_T and t_0 after applying a power transformation (raising to the power of 1/2) and then raises the result back to the original power (squared) before returning these time steps.

If an unsupported skip_type is provided, the function raises a ValueError, ensuring that only valid options are processed.

The get_time_steps function is called by the get_orders_and_timesteps_for_singlestep_solver function, which is responsible for determining the order of steps for a sampling process in a singlestep DPM-Solver. In this context, get_time_steps is utilized to obtain the appropriate time steps based on the specified skip type and the number of steps required for the solver.

**Note**: It is crucial to ensure that the skip_type parameter is one of the supported options ('logSNR', 'time_uniform', or 'time_quadratic') to avoid errors. Additionally, the values of t_T and t_0 should be chosen carefully to reflect the desired time interval for sampling.

**Output Example**: For an input with skip_type as 'logSNR', t_T as 1.0, t_0 as 0.0, N as 5, and device as 'cpu', the function might return a tensor containing intermediate time steps such as [0.8, 0.6, 0.4, 0.2, 0.0].

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· steps: An integer representing the total number of steps to be taken in the sampling process.
· order: An integer indicating the order of the steps, which can be 1, 2, or 3.
· skip_type: A string that specifies the method for generating time steps, which can be 'logSNR' or other types.
· t_T: A float representing the starting time point for the time steps.
· t_0: A float representing the ending time point for the time steps.
· device: A string or object indicating the device (e.g., CPU or GPU) on which the computations will be performed.

**Code Description**: The get_orders_and_timesteps_for_singlestep_solver function is designed to compute the order of steps and the corresponding time steps for a sampling process in a singlestep DPM-Solver. The function first determines the number of groups (K) based on the total number of steps and the specified order. It then generates a list of orders according to the specified order value:

- If the order is 3, the function calculates K and generates a list of orders that consists of 3's, with the last two elements being either 1 and 2 or just 1, depending on the remainder of steps when divided by 3.
- If the order is 2, it generates a list of 2's, with the last element being 1 if the total steps are odd.
- If the order is 1, it simply creates a list of 1's for all steps.

After determining the orders, the function checks the skip_type. If the skip_type is 'logSNR', it calls the get_time_steps function to compute the time steps using the specified starting and ending time points (t_T and t_0) and the number of groups (K). If the skip_type is not 'logSNR', it computes the time steps based on the total number of steps and the generated orders, utilizing the get_time_steps function to obtain the appropriate time steps.

The get_time_steps function is crucial in this process as it generates the intermediate time steps based on the specified skip type, ensuring that the sampling process adheres to the desired characteristics defined by the user.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the order parameter is one of the valid options (1, 2, or 3) to avoid raising a ValueError. Additionally, the skip_type should be chosen carefully to reflect the desired method for generating time steps, as this will affect the output of the function.

**Output Example**: For an input with steps as 6, order as 3, skip_type as 'logSNR', t_T as 1.0, t_0 as 0.0, and device as 'cpu', the function might return a tuple containing the computed time steps and the orders, such as (tensor([0.8, 0.6, 0.4, 0.2, 0.0]), [3, 3, 2, 1]).

The primary purpose of this function is to refine the input data by leveraging the underlying data prediction model, which incorporates noise predictions and other adjustments to enhance the quality of the output.

The denoise_to_zero_fn is integral to the overall denoising workflow, particularly in scenarios where the model aims to transition from a noisy observation to a cleaner representation of the original data. By invoking data_prediction_fn, it ensures that the denoising process adheres to the principles of solving the ODE, thereby achieving a more accurate and reliable output.

The relationship with its callees is significant; the denoise_to_zero_fn relies on the data_prediction_fn to perform the actual computation of the denoised output. The data_prediction_fn method itself is responsible for applying thresholding and noise adjustments, which are crucial for producing a refined estimate of the original data. This hierarchical interaction emphasizes the modular design of the code, where denoise_to_zero_fn serves as a high-level function that delegates the detailed processing to data_prediction_fn.

**Note**: It is essential to ensure that the input tensor x is properly formatted and that the time step s is within the valid range expected by the data_prediction_fn to avoid any runtime errors. The function assumes that the model has been appropriately initialized and is capable of processing the provided input data.

**Output Example**: A possible output of the denoise_to_zero_fn could be a tensor representing the denoised data, which may look like this:

Initially, it checks the shape of the time step tensor `t` and reshapes it if necessary. The function then evaluates the `variant` attribute of the class instance. If the variant includes 'bh', it invokes the multistep_uni_pc_bh_update method, which implements a specific multistep update strategy tailored for the B(h) solver type. Conversely, if the variant is 'vary_coeff', it calls the multistep_uni_pc_vary_update method, which employs a unified predictor-corrector approach with variable coefficients.

**Code Description**: The sample function orchestrates a multistep sampling procedure by iterating through the specified timesteps and applying a unified predictor-corrector approach to generate samples. The function begins by determining the device of the input tensor x and calculating the number of steps based on the length of the timesteps tensor. If the specified method is 'multistep', the function asserts that the number of steps is sufficient for the given order.

During each iteration, the function updates the input tensor x based on the noise schedule and the model's predictions. It utilizes the model_fn to obtain predictions, which can either be noise predictions or data predictions, depending on the state of the model. The multistep_uni_pc_update function is called to perform the actual update of the input tensor x based on previous model outputs and time steps.

The function also includes provisions for handling the final steps differently based on the specified order and whether to use a corrector. If a callback function is provided, it is executed at each step to allow for custom processing of the intermediate results.

The sample function is called by the sample_unipc function, which serves as a higher-level interface for generating samples using the UniPC class. The sample_unipc function prepares the input data and timesteps, initializes the UniPC instance, and invokes the sample method to perform the sampling process.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the input parameters are correctly specified, particularly the timesteps and the input tensor x, to avoid runtime errors and ensure accurate sampling results.

**Output Example**: A possible output of the sample function could be a tensor representing the generated samples, which may look like this:
```
tensor([[0.3, -0.1, 0.5],
        [0.0, 0.2, -0.3]])
```
The actual output will depend on the input data x, the specified timesteps, and the internal state of the model during execution.

## FunctionDef interpolate_fn(x, xp, yp)
**interpolate_fn**: The function of interpolate_fn is to compute a piecewise linear interpolation based on given keypoints.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· x: A PyTorch tensor with shape [N, C], where N is the batch size and C is the number of channels (typically C = 1 for DPM-Solver).
· xp: A PyTorch tensor with shape [C, K], where K is the number of keypoints.
· yp: A PyTorch tensor with shape [C, K] representing the function values corresponding to the keypoints in xp.

**Code Description**: The interpolate_fn function implements a piecewise linear interpolation method that is differentiable, making it suitable for use in automatic differentiation frameworks like PyTorch. The function takes in three tensors: x, xp, and yp. The tensor x represents the input values for which the function values need to be computed. The tensors xp and yp represent the keypoints for the interpolation, where xp contains the x-coordinates of the keypoints and yp contains the corresponding y-coordinates.

The function begins by determining the batch size (N) and the number of keypoints (K). It then concatenates the input tensor x with the keypoints tensor xp to create a combined tensor that is sorted to facilitate the interpolation process. The indices of the sorted tensor are used to find the appropriate segments for interpolation.

The function calculates the start and end indices for the interpolation segments based on the sorted values. It handles edge cases where the input x is outside the bounds of the keypoints xp by using the nearest keypoints to define the linear function. The function values are computed using the linear interpolation formula, which is applied to the gathered y-values from yp corresponding to the determined start and end indices.

This function is called within the marginal_log_mean_coeff and inverse_lambda methods of the NoiseScheduleVP class. In marginal_log_mean_coeff, interpolate_fn is used to compute log(alpha_t) for a given continuous-time label t when the scheduling method is 'discrete'. Similarly, in inverse_lambda, interpolate_fn is utilized to compute the continuous-time label t from a given half-logSNR lambda_t when the scheduling method is also 'discrete'. This highlights the function's role in providing interpolated values that are essential for the calculations performed in these methods.

**Note**: When using this function, ensure that the input tensors x, xp, and yp are appropriately shaped and that the values in xp are sorted for correct interpolation results.

**Output Example**: Given an input tensor x of shape [2, 1], xp of shape [1, 3], and yp of shape [1, 3], a possible output could be a tensor of shape [2, 1] containing the interpolated function values corresponding to the inputs. For example, if x = [[0.5], [1.5]], xp = [[0.0, 1.0, 2.0]], and yp = [[0.0, 1.0, 0.0]], the output might look like [[0.5], [0.75]].
## FunctionDef expand_dims(v, dims)
**expand_dims**: The function of expand_dims is to expand the dimensions of a given PyTorch tensor to a specified number of dimensions.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· v: a PyTorch tensor with shape [N].
· dims: an integer representing the total number of dimensions the output tensor should have.

**Code Description**: The expand_dims function takes a PyTorch tensor `v` and an integer `dims` as input. It expands the tensor `v` to have a total of `dims` dimensions. The output tensor will have the shape [N, 1, 1, ..., 1], where the number of 1's is equal to `dims - 1`. This is achieved by using the ellipsis (`...`) to retain the original dimensions of `v` and appending `None` for the additional dimensions.

The expand_dims function is utilized in various parts of the codebase, particularly in the noise prediction and data prediction functions. For instance, in the noise_pred_fn function, expand_dims is called to adjust the dimensions of the alpha_t and sigma_t tensors to match the dimensions of the input tensor `x`. This ensures that the operations involving these tensors are compatible in terms of shape, which is crucial for performing element-wise operations in PyTorch.

In the model_fn function, expand_dims is similarly used to align the dimensions of the sigma_t tensor when calculating the conditional gradients. This is essential for maintaining the correct tensor shapes during the computation of the model's output.

Additionally, in the dynamic_thresholding_fn and data_prediction_fn functions, expand_dims is employed to ensure that the scaling factors derived from the noise schedule are appropriately expanded to match the dimensions of the input tensors. This is particularly important for operations that involve clamping and normalizing the input data.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the input tensor `v` has a shape that is compatible with the specified `dims`. If `dims` is less than or equal to the current number of dimensions of `v`, the function will not behave as intended.

**Output Example**: For an input tensor `v` with shape [3] and `dims` set to 4, the output will be a tensor with shape [3, 1, 1, 1].

It derives the standard deviation from the marginal_log_mean_coeff(t) by applying the square root to the expression (1 - exp(2 * marginal_log_mean_coeff(t))). This is crucial for understanding the spread of the distribution at time t.

- marginal_lambda(t): This method calculates the lambda value for a given continuous-time label t, defined as the difference between the logarithm of alpha_t and the logarithm of sigma_t. It utilizes the marginal_log_mean_coeff(t) and computes the logarithm of the standard deviation to derive this value. This calculation is significant in the context of continuous-time probabilistic models, as it provides insights into the relationship between the mean and variance.

The SigmaConvert class is instantiated in the sample_unipc function, where it is used to compute the alpha and standard deviation values necessary for image processing in a noise reduction context. Specifically, it modifies the input image based on the computed alpha and standard deviation values, allowing for effective noise addition or removal based on the specified parameters. The computed values are integral to the functioning of the UniPC class, which performs sampling based on the model's predictions.

**Note**: Users should ensure that the input values for sigma and t are within valid ranges to avoid computational errors, as the methods rely on mathematical transformations that can lead to undefined behavior if not handled properly.

**Output Example**: A possible output from the marginal_alpha method when called with a specific value of t might return a tensor representing the computed alpha value, which could look like: tensor([0.7071]), indicating the scaling factor for the image processing operation.

**marginal_std**: The function of marginal_std is to compute the marginal standard deviation based on the logarithm of the mean coefficient.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· t: A tensor representing the time variable in the noise schedule.

**Code Description**: The marginal_std function calculates the standard deviation associated with a given time variable \( t \) in the context of a noise schedule. It achieves this by utilizing the marginal_log_mean_coeff function to compute the logarithm of the mean coefficient, which is then used to derive the standard deviation through the formula \( \sqrt{1 - e^{2 \cdot \text{log_mean_coeff}}} \).

1. The function first calls marginal_log_mean_coeff(t), which computes the logarithm of the mean coefficient for the given time \( t \). This coefficient is crucial for understanding the behavior of the noise schedule.

**Code Description**: The predict_eps_sigma function takes a model, input data, and a noise level (sigma) to compute the predicted noise. It first reshapes the sigma tensor to match the dimensions of the input tensor, ensuring that the noise level is applied correctly across all dimensions. The input is then scaled by the square root of the sum of the squared sigma and one, effectively normalizing the input based on the noise level. Finally, the function returns the difference between the scaled input and the model's prediction of the noise, divided by the sigma. This operation is crucial in noise prediction tasks, particularly in generative models where the quality of the output is heavily dependent on accurate noise estimation.

The predict_eps_sigma function is called within the sample_unipc function.

The function then initializes an instance of SigmaConvert to facilitate the computation of statistical properties related to noise.

If an image is provided, it is modified based on the computed alpha value from the noise schedule, which adjusts the image according to the noise level. The noise is then added to the image, either scaled by a noise multiplier or directly if max_denoise is enabled.

The function wraps the model using model_wrapper, which prepares the model function to accept continuous time as input and predict noise based on the specified guidance type. A UniPC instance is created, which implements the unified predictor-corrector algorithm for sampling.

The sampling process is executed through the sample method of the UniPC class, which iteratively updates the input image based on the model's predictions and the specified timesteps. The final output is normalized by the marginal alpha value corresponding to the last timestep, ensuring that the generated image is appropriately scaled.

The sample_unipc function is called by other sampling functions within the project, such as those in the UNIPC and UNIPCBH2 classes. These functions pass the necessary parameters, including the model, noise, and additional arguments, to perform sampling and denoising using the unified predictor-corrector approach.

**Note**: Users should ensure that the input parameters, particularly the model and noise tensors, are correctly specified to avoid runtime errors. Additionally, the choice of variant can influence the performance and results of the sampling process.

```
tensor([[0.5, 0.3, 0.7],
        [0.1, 0.4, 0.6]])
```
The actual output will depend on the input image, noise, and the internal state of the model during execution.
