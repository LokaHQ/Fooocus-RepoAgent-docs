· output_clip: A boolean flag indicating whether to include the CLIP component in the output (default is True).

**Code Description**: The load_checkpoint function is designed to facilitate the loading of model components from a specified checkpoint file. It begins by constructing the full path to the checkpoint file using the get_full_path function from the ldm_patched.utils.path_utils module. This function ensures that the correct file path is retrieved based on the provided checkpoint name and the predefined folder structure.

Once the full path to the checkpoint is obtained, the load_checkpoint function calls the load_checkpoint_guess_config function from the ldm_patched.modules.sd module. This function is responsible for loading various components of the model, including the main model, VAE, and CLIP components, based on the checkpoint file. The parameters output_vae and output_clip are passed to this function to control whether the VAE and CLIP components should be included in the output.

The load_checkpoint function then returns a tuple containing specific elements from the output of load_checkpoint_guess_config. Specifically, it returns the first element (the model), the fourth element (the VAE filename), and the third element (the CLIP model). This structured output allows other components in the project to easily access the loaded model components for further processing or inference.

The load_checkpoint function is typically called by various loader classes within the project, such as CheckpointLoader and unCLIPCheckpointLoader. These loaders utilize load_checkpoint to retrieve the necessary model components from checkpoint files, ensuring that the models are correctly configured for use in different tasks.

**Note**: It is essential to ensure that the checkpoint file specified by ckpt_name exists in the designated checkpoints folder. If the file does not exist or is not accessible, the function may fail to load the model components as intended.

### FunctionDef encode(self, clip_vision, init_image, vae, width, height, video_frames, motion_bucket_id, fps, augmentation_level)
**encode**: The function of encode is to process an initial image and generate latent representations for video frames, incorporating motion and augmentation parameters.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· clip_vision: An object responsible for encoding images into a latent space representation.  
· init_image: A tensor representing the initial image to be encoded.  
· vae: A Variational Autoencoder object used for encoding pixel data into latent representations.  
· width: An integer specifying the target width for the encoded images.  
· height: An integer specifying the target height for the encoded images.  
· video_frames: An integer indicating the number of video frames to be generated.  
· motion_bucket_id: An identifier used to categorize motion characteristics in the generated video.  
· fps: An integer representing the frames per second for the video output.  
· augmentation_level: A float value that determines the level of random noise added to the pixel data for augmentation purposes.

**Code Description**: The encode function begins by encoding the initial image using the clip_vision object's encode_image method, resulting in a latent representation stored in the variable output. This representation is then expanded by adding a new dimension using unsqueeze(0), which prepares it for further processing.

Next, the function utilizes the common_upscale method from the ldm_patched.modules.utils module to resize the initial image to the specified width and height. The pixels are adjusted to retain only the first three channels, which are typically the RGB channels, and stored in the encode_pixels variable. If the augmentation_level is greater than zero, random noise is added to the pixel data to enhance variability in the encoding process.

The function then encodes the augmented pixel data using the vae's encode method, producing a latent representation stored in the variable t. Two lists, positive and negative, are created to represent the encoded data. The positive list contains the pooled image representation along with a dictionary of parameters, including motion_bucket_id, fps, augmentation_level, and the concatenated latent image t. The negative list contains a tensor of zeros with the same shape as pooled, indicating a lack of encoded data for negative samples.

Finally, the function initializes a latent tensor filled with zeros, shaped according to the number of video frames and the dimensions required for the latent representation. The function returns a tuple containing the positive and negative lists along with a dictionary that includes the latent tensor.

This function is integral to the video generation process, as it prepares the necessary latent representations that will be used in subsequent stages of video synthesis. The encode function relies on the common_upscale function to ensure that the input images are appropriately resized, and it interacts with the VAE to encode pixel data into a latent space, which is crucial for generating coherent video frames.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the input image (init_image) is in the correct format and dimensions before calling the encode function. The function assumes that the clip_vision and vae objects are properly initialized and configured for encoding tasks.

**Output Example**: The output of the encode function may resemble the following structure:
```
(
    [
        [pooled_tensor, {"motion_bucket_id": 1, "fps": 30, "augmentation_level": 0.5, "concat_latent_image": latent_tensor}],
    ],
    [
        [torch.zeros_like(pooled_tensor), {"motion_bucket_id": 1, "fps": 30, "augmentation_level": 0.5, "concat_latent_image": torch.zeros_like(latent_tensor)}],
    ],
    {"samples": latent_tensor}
)
```

## ClassDef VideoLinearCFGGuidance
**VideoLinearCFGGuidance**: The function of VideoLinearCFGGuidance is to apply linear conditional guidance to a video model during sampling.

**attributes**: The attributes of this Class.
· INPUT_TYPES: Specifies the required input types for the class method.
· RETURN_TYPES: Defines the type of output returned by the class method.
· FUNCTION: Indicates the function name that will be executed.
· CATEGORY: Categorizes the class within the sampling/video_models domain.

**Code Description**: The VideoLinearCFGGuidance class is designed to modify a video model by applying a linear conditional guidance function. This is achieved through the `patch` method, which takes a model and a minimum configuration value (`min_cfg`) as inputs. The `INPUT_TYPES` class method outlines the expected input parameters, which include a model of type "MODEL" and a floating-point number for `min_cfg` with specific constraints (default value of 1.0, minimum of 0.0, maximum of 100.0, step of 0.5, and rounded to two decimal places). The `RETURN_TYPES` attribute indicates that the method will return a tuple containing a modified model of type "MODEL". The `FUNCTION` attribute specifies that the method to be executed is named "patch".

Within the `patch` method, a nested function `linear_cfg` is defined. This function computes a linear interpolation between two conditions: `cond` (the conditioned input) and `uncond` (the unconditional input). The `cond_scale` parameter determines the scaling factor for the interpolation. The method uses PyTorch to create a linear space from `min_cfg` to `cond_scale`, reshaping it to match the dimensions of the conditioned input. The final output of the `linear_cfg` function is a combination of the unconditional input and the scaled difference between the conditioned and unconditional inputs.

The original model is cloned to ensure that the modifications do not affect the original model. The `set_model_sampler_cfg_function` method is called on the cloned model to set the newly defined `linear_cfg` function as its configuration function. Finally, the modified model is returned as a single-element tuple.

**Note**: When utilizing this class, ensure that the input model is compatible with the expected "MODEL" type and that the `min_cfg` value adheres to the defined constraints. The linear guidance function will only be effective if the model supports conditional sampling.

**Output Example**: A possible return value from the `patch` method could be a modified model instance that has been configured to use the linear conditional guidance function, represented as a tuple: `(modified_model_instance,)`.
### FunctionDef INPUT_TYPES(s)

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· s: This parameter is not utilized within the function body but is typically included to maintain a consistent function signature for potential future use or for compatibility with other similar functions.

**Code Description**: The INPUT_TYPES function constructs and returns a dictionary that specifies the required input types for a model. The returned dictionary contains a single key, "required", which maps to another dictionary. This inner dictionary defines two required inputs: "model" and "min_cfg". 

- The "model" input is expected to be of type "MODEL", indicating that it requires a specific model type as input.
- The "min_cfg" input is defined as a floating-point number ("FLOAT") with several constraints:
  - It has a default value of 1.0.
  - It must be within a minimum value of 0.0 and a maximum value of 100.0.
  - The input can be adjusted in increments of 0.5 (defined by the "step" parameter).
  - The value will be rounded to two decimal places (as specified by the "round" parameter).

This structured approach ensures that the function clearly communicates the expected types and constraints for the inputs, facilitating proper usage and validation in the context of model configuration.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the inputs provided to the function adhere to the specified types and constraints to avoid runtime errors or unexpected behavior in the model configuration process.

**Output Example**: A possible appearance of the code's return value could be:
{
    "required": {
        "model": ("MODEL",),
        "min_cfg": ("FLOAT", {"default": 1.0, "min": 0.0, "max": 100.0, "step": 0.5, "round": 0.01})
    }

### FunctionDef patch(self, model, min_cfg)
**patch**: The function of patch is to modify a model by setting a linear conditional guidance function based on a minimum configuration value.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· model: The model instance that is to be modified with a new sampling configuration function.
· min_cfg: A float value representing the minimum configuration scale used in the linear conditional guidance.

**Code Description**: The patch function takes a model and a minimum configuration value as inputs. It defines an inner function, linear_cfg, which computes a linear interpolation between two conditional inputs, "cond" and "uncond", based on a scaling factor. The scaling factor is generated using `torch.linspace`, which creates a tensor of values ranging from min_cfg to cond_scale, with the same number of elements as the first dimension of the "cond" tensor. This scaling tensor is reshaped to match the dimensions required for broadcasting during the calculation. The linear_cfg function then returns a weighted sum of the "uncond" and "cond" tensors, effectively blending them according to the computed scale.

After defining the linear_cfg function, the patch function clones the input model to create a new instance (m). It then sets the model's sampling configuration function to the newly defined linear_cfg. Finally, the function returns a tuple containing the modified model.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the model being patched supports the method set_model_sampler_cfg_function, as this is essential for the proper functioning of the patch. Additionally, the input tensors "cond" and "uncond" must be appropriately shaped to avoid broadcasting errors during the computation.

**Output Example**: The return value of the patch function is a tuple containing the modified model instance. For example, if the original model was an instance of a class named VideoModel, the output might look like (VideoModel instance with updated configuration,).
#### FunctionDef linear_cfg(args)
**linear_cfg**: The function of linear_cfg is to compute a linear combination of conditional and unconditional inputs based on a scaling factor.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· args: A dictionary containing the following keys:
  - cond: A tensor representing the conditional input.
  - uncond: A tensor representing the unconditional input.
  - cond_scale: A float value that determines the scaling factor for the conditional input.

**Code Description**: The linear_cfg function takes a dictionary of arguments and performs a linear interpolation between two tensors: the conditional input (cond) and the unconditional input (uncond). The function begins by extracting the necessary values from the args dictionary. It retrieves the conditional tensor (cond), the unconditional tensor (uncond), and the scaling factor (cond_scale).

Next, the function generates a scale tensor using PyTorch's linspace function. This tensor is created to have a range from a predefined minimum configuration value (min_cfg) to the specified cond_scale. The scale tensor is reshaped to match the dimensions of the conditional input, ensuring that it can be broadcasted correctly during the subsequent calculations.

Finally, the function computes the output by adding the unconditional input to the product of the scale and the difference between the conditional and unconditional inputs. This results in a tensor that smoothly transitions between the two inputs based on the scaling factor.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the shapes of the cond and uncond tensors are compatible for the operations performed in this function. Additionally, the variable min_cfg should be defined in the scope where this function is used, as it is not provided within the function itself.

**Output Example**: If cond is a tensor of shape (5, 3, 32, 32), uncond is a tensor of the same shape, and cond_scale is set to 1.0, the output will be a tensor of the same shape, representing a linear interpolation based on the specified scaling factor. For instance, if cond contains values [1, 2, 3] and uncond contains values [0, 0, 0], the output could be a tensor with values that reflect the linear combination influenced by cond_scale.
