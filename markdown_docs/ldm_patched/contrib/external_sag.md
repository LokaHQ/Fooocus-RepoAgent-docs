## FunctionDef attention_basic_with_sim(q, k, v, heads, mask)
**attention_basic_with_sim**: The function of attention_basic_with_sim is to compute the scaled dot-product attention with similarity scores between query, key, and value tensors, while optionally applying a mask.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· q: A tensor representing the query input of shape (b, seq_length, dim_head), where b is the batch size and dim_head is the dimensionality of each head.
· k: A tensor representing the key input of shape (b, seq_length, dim_head).
· v: A tensor representing the value input of shape (b, seq_length, dim_head).
· heads: An integer representing the number of attention heads to use.
· mask: An optional tensor used to mask certain positions in the attention scores.

**Code Description**: The attention_basic_with_sim function begins by extracting the batch size (b) and the dimensionality of the head (dim_head) from the shape of the query tensor (q). It calculates the scale factor based on the number of heads to prevent overly large dot-product values. The function then reshapes the query, key, and value tensors to facilitate multi-head attention by unsqueezing and permuting the dimensions accordingly.

The function computes the similarity scores between the query and key tensors using the Einstein summation convention (einsum). Depending on the precision setting (_ATTN_PRECISION), it either casts the tensors to float32 to avoid overflow or computes the similarity directly. If a mask is provided, it reshapes and applies the mask to the similarity scores, filling masked positions with a large negative value to ensure they do not contribute to the final attention scores.

The similarity scores are then normalized using the softmax function to obtain the attention weights. The output is computed by multiplying the attention weights with the value tensor, followed by reshaping the result to match the expected output format.

This function is called within the attn_and_record function of the SelfAttentionGuidance class. In this context, it is used to perform the attention operation while saving the attention scores when certain conditions are met (specifically when the input is unconditioned). The output of attention_basic_with_sim is then utilized to retrieve the attention scores for further analysis or processing.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the input tensors (q, k, v) are of compatible shapes and that the mask, if used, is correctly formatted to match the batch size and number of heads.

**Output Example**: A possible return value of the function could be a tuple where the first element is a tensor of shape (b, seq_length, heads * dim_head) representing the output of the attention mechanism, and the second element is a tensor of shape (b, seq_length, seq_length) representing the similarity scores between the queries and keys.
## FunctionDef create_blur_map(x0, attn, sigma, threshold)
**create_blur_map**: The function of create_blur_map is to generate a blurred version of an input image based on an attention map, selectively applying Gaussian blur to areas of interest.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· x0: A 4D tensor representing the input image, with shape (batch_size, channels, height, width).
· attn: A tensor representing the attention map, with shape (batch_size, num_heads, height, width).
· sigma: A float that specifies the standard deviation of the Gaussian distribution, controlling the amount of blur. Default value is 3.0.
· threshold: A float that determines the threshold for the attention mask. Areas with attention values above this threshold will be considered for blurring. Default value is 1.0.

**Code Description**: The create_blur_map function begins by reshaping the attention map (attn) to facilitate processing. It extracts the height and width dimensions from the attention map and the input image. The attention map is reshaped to have dimensions (batch_size, -1, hw1, hw2), where hw1 and hw2 correspond to the height and width of the attention map.

Next, the function computes a mask by performing a Global Average Pooling (GAP) operation on the attention map. This mask is generated by averaging the attention values across the heads and summing them, then applying a threshold to determine which areas of the image will be blurred. The mask is then reshaped to match a reduced spatial size based on the ratio derived from the input image dimensions.

The mask is subsequently upsampled to the original dimensions of the input image using bilinear interpolation. This allows for the selective application of the Gaussian blur effect. The function then calls the gaussian_blur_2d function to apply a Gaussian blur to the input image (x0) with a specified kernel size and sigma value.

Finally, the blurred image is combined with the original image using the mask. Areas where the mask is true will show the blurred image, while areas where the mask is false will retain the original image. This results in a composite image that highlights regions of interest based on the attention map.

The create_blur_map function is called within the post_cfg_function, which is part of a larger model processing pipeline. In this context, it is used to create an adversarially blurred image from the unconditional predictions and attention scores before further processing in a neural network model. This integration allows for enhanced control over the image generation process by leveraging attention mechanisms.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the sigma and threshold parameters are set appropriately to achieve the desired level of blurring and to effectively highlight the relevant areas of the image.

**Output Example**: The output of the create_blur_map function is a tensor representing the blurred image, which retains the same shape as the input image tensor. For example, if the input image tensor has a shape of (1, 3, 256, 256), the output will also have a shape of (1, 3, 256, 256), with pixel values modified to reflect the selective Gaussian blur effect based on the attention map.
## FunctionDef gaussian_blur_2d(img, kernel_size, sigma)
**gaussian_blur_2d**: The function of gaussian_blur_2d is to apply a Gaussian blur effect to a 2D image tensor.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· img: A 4D tensor representing the input image, with shape (batch_size, channels, height, width).
· kernel_size: An integer that defines the size of the Gaussian kernel. It must be an odd number.
· sigma: A float that specifies the standard deviation of the Gaussian distribution, controlling the amount of blur.

**Code Description**: The gaussian_blur_2d function performs a Gaussian blur on a given 2D image tensor. It begins by calculating half the kernel size to determine the range for generating the Gaussian distribution. The function uses PyTorch's linspace to create a 1D tensor of values ranging from -ksize_half to ksize_half, which is then transformed into a probability density function (PDF) representing the Gaussian distribution. This PDF is normalized to create the x_kernel, which is then expanded into a 2D kernel using matrix multiplication.

The function pads the input image using reflection to ensure that the edges are handled correctly during the convolution operation. The convolution is performed using the 2D Gaussian kernel, applied across the input image's channels. The output is a blurred version of the input image, where the degree of blurring is determined by the kernel size and sigma values.

This function is called by the create_blur_map function, which reshapes and processes an attention map before applying the Gaussian blur. The create_blur_map function generates a mask based on the attention values and uses the gaussian_blur_2d function to create a blurred image. The blurred image is then combined with the original image based on the mask, allowing for selective blurring based on the attention map.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the kernel_size parameter is an odd integer to maintain symmetry in the Gaussian kernel. The sigma parameter should be chosen based on the desired level of blurring.

**Output Example**: The output of the gaussian_blur_2d function is a tensor representing the blurred image, which retains the same shape as the input image tensor. For example, if the input image tensor has a shape of (1, 3, 256, 256), the output will also have a shape of (1, 3, 256, 256), with pixel values modified to reflect the Gaussian blur effect.
## ClassDef SelfAttentionGuidance
**SelfAttentionGuidance**: The function of SelfAttentionGuidance is to modify a model's attention mechanism by applying self-attention guidance with adjustable parameters for scaling and blurring.

**attributes**: The attributes of this Class.
· INPUT_TYPES: Defines the required input types for the class methods, including model, scale, and blur_sigma.
· RETURN_TYPES: Specifies the return type of the class methods, which is a tuple containing "MODEL".
· FUNCTION: Indicates the main function of the class, which is "patch".
· CATEGORY: Categorizes the class under "_for_testing".

**Code Description**: The SelfAttentionGuidance class is designed to enhance a model's attention mechanism by applying a patch function that modifies how attention scores are calculated and utilized. The class defines a method called `patch`, which takes in a model, a scale factor, and a blur sigma value. 

The `patch` method begins by cloning the provided model to avoid altering the original. It initializes a variable `attn_scores` to store attention scores during the attention operation. The method defines an inner function `attn_and_record`, which captures attention scores when the model processes input queries, keys, and values. This function checks if the input is unconditional and, if so, computes the attention scores while performing the attention operation.

Another inner function, `post_cfg_function`, is defined to handle the post-processing of the model's output. It utilizes the previously recorded attention scores to create a blurred version of the input, which is then combined with the model's output. This function ensures that the model's output is adjusted based on the self-attention guidance parameters, specifically the scale and blur sigma.

The `patch` method sets the model's sampling function to the `post_cfg_function` and replaces the model's attention mechanism with the `attn_and_record` function. Finally, it returns the modified model.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the input dimensions are appropriate, as the method skips processing if the dimensions are too small. Additionally, the class is primarily intended for testing purposes, as indicated by its category.

**Output Example**: The return value of the `patch` method is a tuple containing the modified model. For instance, the output could look like this: (modified_model_instance,).
### FunctionDef INPUT_TYPES(s)
**INPUT_TYPES**: The function of INPUT_TYPES is to define and return the required input types for a specific model configuration.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· model: This parameter represents the model type, which is expected to be of type "MODEL".
· scale: This parameter is a floating-point number that specifies the scaling factor. It has a default value of 0.5, with a minimum value of -2.0, a maximum value of 5.0, and a step increment of 0.1.
· blur_sigma: This parameter is also a floating-point number that determines the standard deviation for Gaussian blur. It has a default value of 2.0, with a minimum value of 0.0, a maximum value of 10.0, and a step increment of 0.1.

**Code Description**: The INPUT_TYPES function is designed to return a dictionary that specifies the required input types for a model. The dictionary contains a single key, "required", which maps to another dictionary that defines three parameters: "model", "scale", and "blur_sigma". Each of these parameters is associated with a tuple that indicates its type and, for the floating-point parameters, additional constraints such as default values, minimum and maximum limits, and step increments. This structured approach ensures that the inputs to the model are validated and constrained within specified ranges, promoting robustness and preventing errors during model execution.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the values provided for "scale" and "blur_sigma" adhere to the defined constraints to avoid runtime errors. The "model" parameter must be correctly specified as a valid model type.

**Output Example**: An example of the return value of the INPUT_TYPES function could look like this:
{
    "required": {
        "model": ("MODEL",),
        "scale": ("FLOAT", {"default": 0.5, "min": -2.0, "max": 5.0, "step": 0.1}),
        "blur_sigma": ("FLOAT", {"default": 2.0, "min": 0.0, "max": 10.0, "step": 0.1}),
    }
}

### FunctionDef patch(self, model, scale, blur_sigma)
**patch**: The function of patch is to modify a given model to record attention scores during the attention operation and apply a post-configuration function for image processing.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· model: The model to be patched, which is expected to be a cloneable instance of a neural network.
· scale: A scaling factor used in the post-configuration function to adjust the output.
· blur_sigma: A parameter that defines the standard deviation for the Gaussian blur applied to the image.

**Code Description**: The patch function begins by cloning the provided model to ensure that the original model remains unaltered. It initializes a variable `attn_scores` to store the attention scores during the attention operation. The function defines an inner function `attn_and_record`, which performs the attention operation and records the attention scores if the input is unconditioned. It checks the number of heads and whether the input is conditioned or unconditioned. If unconditioned, it computes the attention scores using a basic attention mechanism and saves the relevant scores to `attn_scores`. If the input is conditioned, it uses an optimized attention function.

Another inner function, `post_cfg_function`, is defined to handle the post-configuration processing. This function takes various arguments, including the model, unconditioned predictions, and the input image. It checks if the dimensions of the configuration result are sufficient to apply padding. If they are, it creates a blurred version of the unconditioned prediction using the `create_blur_map` function, adds noise to it, and then calls the model's sampler to compute the final output. The output is adjusted by scaling the difference between the degraded image and the output from the model.

The patch function then sets the post-configuration function in the cloned model using `set_model_sampler_post_cfg_function`, disabling certain optimizations. Additionally, it replaces a specific attention mechanism in the model with the `attn_and_record` function to ensure that attention scores are recorded during the model's operation.

Finally, the function returns a tuple containing the modified model.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the model being patched supports the operations defined in this function, particularly the attention mechanisms and the post-configuration function. The function assumes that the model can handle the specified input dimensions and that the attention mechanism is compatible with the provided parameters.

**Output Example**: A possible return value of the patch function could be a tuple containing the modified model instance, which is now capable of recording attention scores and applying the specified post-configuration processing during inference. For example: `(modified_model_instance,)`.
#### FunctionDef attn_and_record(q, k, v, extra_options)
**attn_and_record**: The function of attn_and_record is to perform the attention operation while optionally recording attention scores based on the conditioning of the input.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· q: A tensor representing the query input of shape (b, seq_length, dim_head), where b is the batch size and dim_head is the dimensionality of each head.  
· k: A tensor representing the key input of shape (b, seq_length, dim_head).  
· v: A tensor representing the value input of shape (b, seq_length, dim_head).  
· extra_options: A dictionary containing additional options for the attention operation, including "n_heads" (the number of attention heads) and "cond_or_uncond" (a list indicating whether the input is conditioned or unconditioned).

**Code Description**: The attn_and_record function begins by declaring a nonlocal variable, attn_scores, which is intended to store the attention scores when certain conditions are met. The function retrieves the number of attention heads from the extra_options parameter and checks the conditioning status of the input. The variable b is calculated as the batch size divided by the number of conditioning types.

If the input is determined to be unconditioned (indicated by the presence of '1' in cond_or_uncond), the function proceeds to compute the attention scores using the attention_basic_with_sim function. This function computes the scaled dot-product attention and returns both the output tensor and the similarity scores. The attention scores for the unconditioned input are then extracted from the similarity scores based on the calculated indices, and the output of the attention operation is returned.

In cases where the input is conditioned (when '1' is not present in cond_or_uncond), the function calls optimized_attention instead, which performs the attention operation without recording the attention scores.

The relationship with the attention_basic_with_sim function is crucial, as it allows attn_and_record to leverage the computation of attention scores while maintaining the flexibility to handle both conditioned and unconditioned inputs effectively.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the input tensors (q, k, v) are of compatible shapes and that the extra_options dictionary is correctly formatted to include the necessary keys for the function to operate correctly.

**Output Example**: A possible return value of the function could be a tensor of shape (b, seq_length, heads * dim_head) representing the output of the attention mechanism when the input is unconditioned, or the output from optimized_attention when the input is conditioned.
***
#### FunctionDef post_cfg_function(args)
**post_cfg_function**: The function of post_cfg_function is to apply self-attention guidance to enhance the denoised output of a model based on attention scores and input parameters.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· args: A dictionary containing various inputs required for the function, including the model, unconditional predictions, unconditional inputs, denoised results, sigma value, model options, and input tensor.

**Code Description**: The post_cfg_function begins by accessing the attention scores stored in a nonlocal variable. It initializes several parameters, including the unconditional attention scores, scaling factors, and thresholds for processing. The function retrieves the model and various inputs from the provided arguments, including the unconditional denoised predictions, unconditional inputs, denoised results, sigma, model options, and the input tensor.

The function first checks if the spatial dimensions of the denoised result are too small (less than or equal to 4) to apply further processing. If so, it returns the denoised result immediately, bypassing any additional computations.

If the dimensions are adequate, the function proceeds to create an adversarially blurred image by calling the create_blur_map function. This function generates a blurred version of the unconditional predictions based on the attention scores, applying Gaussian blur selectively to areas of interest. The resulting blurred image is then combined with the input tensor to create a degraded version that is used for further processing.

Next, the post_cfg_function calls the calc_cond_uncond_batch function, which processes the model's conditional and unconditional inputs. This function takes the model, unconditional inputs, and the degraded image, along with the sigma value and model options, to generate the self-attention guided output.

Finally, the function returns the sum of the original denoised result and the scaled difference between the blurred image and the self-attention guided output. This output represents the enhanced denoised result, which incorporates the effects of self-attention guidance.

The post_cfg_function is integral to the model's processing pipeline, as it leverages attention mechanisms to refine the output based on the provided inputs and conditions. It ensures that the generated images are influenced by the relevant areas highlighted by the attention scores, thereby improving the overall quality of the denoised results.

**Note**: It is essential to ensure that the input dimensions are appropriate for processing and that the parameters used in the create_blur_map function are set correctly to achieve the desired blurring effect.

**Output Example**: The output of the post_cfg_function is a tensor representing the enhanced denoised result, which retains the same shape as the input tensor. For example, if the input tensor has a shape of (1, 3, 256, 256), the output will also have a shape of (1, 3, 256, 256), with pixel values adjusted to reflect the self-attention guidance applied during processing.
