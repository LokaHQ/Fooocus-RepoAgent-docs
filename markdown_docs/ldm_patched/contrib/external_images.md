### FunctionDef crop(self, image, width, height, x, y)
**crop**: The function of crop is to extract a specified rectangular region from an image.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· image: A multi-dimensional array representing the image from which a region will be cropped. The expected shape is (channels, height, width, depth).
· width: An integer representing the width of the rectangular region to be cropped.
· height: An integer representing the height of the rectangular region to be cropped.
· x: An integer representing the x-coordinate (horizontal position) of the top-left corner of the cropping rectangle.
· y: An integer representing the y-coordinate (vertical position) of the top-left corner of the cropping rectangle.

**Code Description**: The crop function takes an image and extracts a rectangular area defined by the specified width and height, starting from the coordinates (x, y). The function first ensures that the x and y coordinates do not exceed the image boundaries by using the min function, which compares the provided coordinates with the maximum allowable values based on the image dimensions. The maximum x-coordinate is adjusted to be one less than the width of the image (image.shape[2] - 1), and similarly for y. The function then calculates the bottom-right corner of the cropping rectangle using the provided width and height. It slices the image array to obtain the desired region, which is returned as a tuple containing the cropped image.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the specified width and height, along with the x and y coordinates, do not result in an attempt to access pixels outside the bounds of the image. If the specified coordinates plus the width or height exceed the image dimensions, the function will automatically adjust them to fit within the valid range.

**Output Example**: If the input image has a shape of (3, 100, 100, 3) and the parameters are width=50, height=50, x=10, y=10, the output will be a tuple containing a cropped image of shape (3, 50, 50, 3), representing the selected region from the original image.
***

· RETURN_TYPES: A tuple indicating the return type of the repeat function, which is an image.
· FUNCTION: A string that represents the name of the function to be executed, which is "repeat".
· CATEGORY: A string that categorizes this class under "image/batch".

**Code Description**: The RepeatImageBatch class is designed to handle the repetition of images in a batch processing context. It contains a class method INPUT_TYPES that specifies the inputs required for the repeat function. The method expects an "image" of type IMAGE and an "amount" of type INT, with constraints on the integer value (default is 1, minimum is 1, and maximum is 64). The class also defines RETURN_TYPES, indicating that the output will be an IMAGE. The FUNCTION attribute specifies that the core functionality is encapsulated in the "repeat" method. 

The repeat method itself takes two parameters: an image and an amount. It utilizes the repeat function of the image object to create a new tensor that repeats the input image along the batch dimension, effectively creating a batch of images. The resulting tensor is returned as a single-element tuple.

**Note**: When using this class, ensure that the input image is compatible with the repeat operation, and that the amount parameter is within the specified range to avoid runtime errors.

**Output Example**: If the input image is a tensor of shape (1, C, H, W) representing a single image, and the amount is set to 3, the output will be a tensor of shape (3, C, H, W), where the original image is repeated three times along the batch dimension.
### FunctionDef INPUT_TYPES(s)
**INPUT_TYPES**: The function of INPUT_TYPES is to define the required input types for a specific operation involving images.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· parameter1: s - This parameter is not utilized within the function body and serves as a placeholder for potential future use or for maintaining a consistent function signature.

**Code Description**: The INPUT_TYPES function returns a dictionary that specifies the required input types for processing an image. The dictionary contains a single key, "required", which maps to another dictionary. This inner dictionary defines two required inputs: "image" and "amount". The "image" input is expected to be of type "IMAGE", indicating that the function requires an image file as input. The "amount" input is expected to be of type "INT", which is an integer value. Additionally, the "amount" input has constraints defined by a dictionary that specifies a default value of 1, a minimum value of 1, and a maximum value of 64. This means that the function can accept an integer input for "amount" that must be within the specified range.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the inputs conform to the specified types and constraints when utilizing this function. The "image" input must be a valid image format, and the "amount" must be an integer within the defined limits.

**Output Example**: An example of the return value from the INPUT_TYPES function would be:
{
    "required": {
        "image": ("IMAGE",),
        "amount": ("INT", {"default": 1, "min": 1, "max": 64}),
    }
}
***
### FunctionDef repeat(self, image, amount)
**repeat**: The function of repeat is to replicate an input image a specified number of times along the batch dimension.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· parameter1: image - This is the input tensor representing the image to be repeated. It is expected to have a shape compatible with the repeat operation, typically in the format (batch_size, channels, height, width).
· parameter2: amount - This is an integer that specifies how many times the input image should be repeated along the batch dimension.

**Code Description**: The repeat function takes an image tensor and an integer amount as inputs. It utilizes the `repeat` method of the tensor to create a new tensor where the input image is duplicated along the first dimension (the batch dimension). The `repeat` method is called with the tuple `(amount, 1, 1, 1)`, which indicates that the image should be repeated 'amount' times while keeping the other dimensions (channels, height, width) unchanged. The result is a new tensor `s` that contains the repeated images. Finally, the function returns a tuple containing this new tensor.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the input image tensor is in the correct format and shape before calling this function. The amount parameter should be a positive integer to avoid unexpected behavior.

**Output Example**: If the input image tensor has a shape of (1, 3, 64, 64) and the amount is set to 3, the output will be a tensor with a shape of (3, 3, 64, 64), containing three copies of the original image.

· prefix_append: A string that can be appended to the filename prefix, initialized as an empty string.

**Code Description**: The SaveAnimatedWEBP class is designed to facilitate the saving of a series of images as an animated WEBP file. Upon initialization, it sets the output directory, output type, and an optional prefix for filenames. The class contains a class-level dictionary named `methods`, which defines various encoding methods available for saving the images.

The primary method of this class is `save_images`, which takes several parameters: a list of images, frames per second (fps), a filename prefix, a boolean indicating whether to save in lossless format, an integer for image quality, and a method for encoding. It also accepts optional parameters for the number of frames to save in each file, a prompt for metadata, and extra PNG information.

Inside the `save_images` method, the specified encoding method is retrieved from the `methods` dictionary. The filename prefix is modified by appending the `prefix_append` attribute. The method then calls a utility function to determine the full output path and filename structure based on the first image's dimensions.

The images are processed into PIL format, and metadata is prepared for inclusion in the output file. If no specific number of frames is provided, it defaults to the total number of images. The method iterates through the images in chunks defined by `num_frames`, saving each chunk as a separate WEBP file with the specified parameters. The results, including the filenames and their respective subfolder paths, are collected and returned in a structured format.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the input images are in a compatible format and that the output directory is writable. The `num_frames` parameter can be adjusted to control how many images are saved in each output file, and the `fps` parameter affects the playback speed of the resulting animation.

**Output Example**: 
{
  "ui": {
    "images": [

· prompt: An optional string or object that provides additional context or information to be embedded in the PNG metadata.
· extra_pnginfo: An optional dictionary containing additional metadata to be included in the PNG file.

**Code Description**: The save_images function is designed to facilitate the saving of a series of images as an animated PNG file. It begins by modifying the provided filename_prefix by appending a specific suffix defined in the class. The function then calls get_save_image_path to generate a structured file path for saving the images, which includes determining the output folder, base filename, and a counter to avoid filename conflicts.

The function processes each image in the input list, converting them from tensor format to PIL image format. This is achieved by scaling the pixel values to the range of 0 to 255 and converting the resulting array into a PIL image. These images are collected in a list for later use.

If the server information is not disabled, the function prepares metadata for the PNG file. This includes adding the prompt information if provided, as well as any additional metadata specified in extra_pnginfo. Each piece of metadata is encoded and added to the PNGInfo object, which will be associated with the saved PNG file.

The function constructs the final filename for the output PNG file, ensuring it includes the appropriate counter to maintain uniqueness. It then saves the first image in the list as a PNG file, using the PIL library's save method. This method allows for the inclusion of the previously prepared metadata, the specified compression level, and the duration for each frame based on the provided fps. The remaining images are appended to the first image to create the animated effect.

Finally, the function compiles the results into a dictionary that includes the filename, subfolder, and type of the saved images, returning this information for further use or logging.

This function is called within the context of image saving operations in the project, ensuring that images are saved in an organized manner while allowing for the inclusion of relevant metadata.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the images provided are in the correct format and that the output directory is valid to prevent errors during the saving process. The function assumes that the input images are tensors that can be converted to numpy arrays.
