## FunctionDef random_divisor(max_options)
**random_divisor**: The function of random_divisor is to return a random divisor of a given integer value within specified constraints.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· value: An integer for which divisors are to be calculated. This is the primary input to determine the divisors.
· min_value: An integer that sets the minimum limit for the divisors to be considered. It ensures that only divisors greater than or equal to this value are included.
· max_options: An optional integer that specifies the maximum number of divisors to consider for random selection. The default value is 1.

**Code Description**: The random_divisor function begins by ensuring that the min_value is not greater than the value itself, thus setting a valid lower bound for the divisor search. It then constructs a list of all divisors of the value that are greater than or equal to min_value. This is achieved through a list comprehension that iterates over a range from min_value to value (inclusive) and checks for divisibility.

Next, the function computes a list of corresponding quotients (ns) by dividing the value by each of the found divisors, limited to the number specified by max_options. If there are multiple options in ns, the function randomly selects one index using the randint function, ensuring that at least one divisor is always returned. The selected divisor is then returned as the output.

In the context of its caller, the random_divisor function is utilized within the hypertile_in function of the HyperTile class. Here, it is employed to determine the new height (nh) and width (nw) for the tensor q based on the original dimensions and a scaling factor. The random divisors are used to adjust the dimensions of the tensor dynamically, ensuring that the resulting shape is compatible with the model's requirements. This integration highlights the function's role in managing tensor dimensions in a neural network context, where flexibility in shape is often necessary for effective processing.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the value provided is a positive integer and that min_value is also a positive integer not greater than value. The function assumes that there will always be at least one valid divisor to return.

**Output Example**: For an input of value = 12, min_value = 2, and max_options = 3, the possible output could be 3, which is one of the divisors of 12 that meets the criteria.
## ClassDef HyperTile
**HyperTile**: The function of HyperTile is to apply a hypertile patching technique to a model, modifying its attention mechanisms for improved performance on specific tasks.

**attributes**: The attributes of this Class.
· INPUT_TYPES: Defines the required input types for the patching function, including model parameters and configuration settings.
· RETURN_TYPES: Specifies the type of output returned by the patch function, which is a modified model.
· FUNCTION: Indicates the name of the method that performs the patching operation.
· CATEGORY: Categorizes the functionality of this class within the broader context of model patches.

**Code Description**: The HyperTile class is designed to enhance a model's performance by implementing a hypertile patching strategy. This class contains a class method `INPUT_TYPES` that specifies the required inputs for the patching process, including the model to be patched, tile size, swap size, maximum depth, and a boolean flag for scaling depth. The method returns a dictionary that outlines these parameters, ensuring that users provide the necessary configurations.

The `patch` method is the core functionality of the class. It takes in the model and the specified parameters, calculates the latent tile size, and defines two inner functions: `hypertile_in` and `hypertile_out`. 

The `hypertile_in` function modifies the input tensors (queries, keys, and values) based on the model's channel configuration and the specified depth. It calculates the dimensions for tiling and rearranges the input tensors accordingly. The function also utilizes a helper function, `random_divisor`, to determine the appropriate dimensions for the tiling based on the provided parameters.

The `hypertile_out` function is responsible for rearranging the output tensors after the model has processed the input. It ensures that the output maintains the correct shape and structure, effectively reversing the changes made during the input patching.

Finally, the method clones the original model and applies the defined input and output patching functions to the model's attention mechanism, returning the modified model as the output.

**Note**: Users should ensure that the input parameters are within the specified ranges to avoid errors during the patching process. The model must support the required configurations for the hypertile patching to be effective.

**Output Example**: The output of the `patch` method will be a modified model that retains the original model's architecture but incorporates the hypertile patching mechanisms. The return value will be a tuple containing the patched model, which can be used for further inference or training tasks.
### FunctionDef INPUT_TYPES(s)
**INPUT_TYPES**: The function of INPUT_TYPES is to define and return a dictionary of required input types for a specific model configuration.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· s: This parameter is not utilized within the function body but is typically included to maintain a consistent function signature for potential future use or for compatibility with other functions.

**Code Description**: The INPUT_TYPES function constructs and returns a dictionary that specifies the required input types for a model. The dictionary contains a single key, "required", which maps to another dictionary detailing the various input parameters necessary for the model configuration. Each input parameter is associated with a tuple that includes the type of the parameter and, in some cases, additional constraints or default values. 

The parameters defined in the returned dictionary are as follows:
- "model": This parameter expects a value of type "MODEL", indicating that a specific model type must be provided.
- "tile_size": This parameter is of type "INT" and has a default value of 256. It also includes constraints that enforce a minimum value of 1 and a maximum value of 2048.
- "swap_size": Similar to tile_size, this parameter is also of type "INT", with a default value of 2, a minimum of 1, and a maximum of 128.
- "max_depth": This parameter is defined as an "INT" type with a default value of 0, allowing a minimum of 0 and a maximum of 10.
- "scale_depth": This parameter is of type "BOOLEAN" and has a default value of False, indicating whether scaling should be applied.

This structured approach allows for clear validation and handling of input parameters when configuring the model, ensuring that all necessary inputs are provided in the correct format.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the input values adhere to the specified types and constraints to avoid runtime errors or unexpected behavior in the model configuration.

**Output Example**: A possible appearance of the code's return value could be:
{
    "required": {
        "model": ("MODEL",),
        "tile_size": ("INT", {"default": 256, "min": 1, "max": 2048}),
        "swap_size": ("INT", {"default": 2, "min": 1, "max": 128}),
        "max_depth": ("INT", {"default": 0, "min": 0, "max": 10}),
        "scale_depth": ("BOOLEAN", {"default": False}),
    }
}

### FunctionDef patch(self, model, tile_size, swap_size, max_depth, scale_depth)
**patch**: The function of patch is to modify a model's attention mechanism by applying hypertile transformations to its input and output.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· model: The model instance that is to be patched with hypertile functionality.
· tile_size: The size of the tiles to be used in the hypertile process.
· swap_size: The size used for swapping during the hypertile process.
· max_depth: The maximum depth for applying the hypertile transformations.
· scale_depth: A boolean indicating whether to scale the depth during the hypertile process.

**Code Description**: The patch function begins by extracting the number of channels from the model's configuration. It calculates the latent tile size based on the provided tile size, ensuring it is at least 32. The function initializes a temporary variable to store intermediate values during the hypertile process.

Two inner functions, hypertile_in and hypertile_out, are defined to handle the input and output transformations, respectively. The hypertile_in function checks if the number of model channels matches any of the dimensions derived from the original shape of the input. If a match is found, it calculates the new height and width based on the aspect ratio of the original shape and the number of tiles. It then rearranges the input tensor to apply the hypertile transformation.

The hypertile_out function reverses the transformation applied by hypertile_in. If the temporary variable is set, it rearranges the output tensor back to its original shape.

Finally, the patch function clones the model and sets the modified attention mechanisms using the defined inner functions. The patched model is returned as a tuple.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the model being patched is compatible with the hypertile transformations. The tile_size and swap_size parameters should be chosen carefully to avoid performance issues.

**Output Example**: The return value of the patch function is a tuple containing the modified model instance, which may look like this: (modified_model_instance,).
#### FunctionDef hypertile_in(q, k, v, extra_options)
**hypertile_in**: The function of hypertile_in is to adjust the dimensions of input tensors based on specified scaling factors and conditions.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· q: A tensor representing the query input, which is subject to dimensional adjustments.
· k: A tensor representing the key input, which is passed through unchanged.
· v: A tensor representing the value input, which is also passed through unchanged.
· extra_options: A dictionary containing additional options, including 'original_shape' that specifies the original dimensions of the input tensor.

**Code Description**: The hypertile_in function begins by determining the number of channels in the query tensor q using its shape. It retrieves the original shape of the tensor from the extra_options parameter. The function then calculates a list of potential dimensions to apply based on a maximum depth, which is not explicitly defined in the provided code but is assumed to be a global variable. This list is generated by halving the original dimensions iteratively.

The function checks if the number of model channels matches any of the calculated dimensions. If a match is found, it proceeds to compute the aspect ratio of the original shape. The height (h) and width (w) of the tensor are derived from the total number of elements in the query tensor, adjusted according to the aspect ratio.

Next, the function determines a scaling factor based on the index of the matched dimension, which is influenced by a variable named scale_depth. It then calls the random_divisor function to compute new height (nh) and width (nw) values for the tensor q, ensuring that these dimensions are compatible with a specified latent tile size and swap size.

If the calculated new dimensions (nh and nw) result in a product greater than one, the function rearranges the query tensor q into a new shape that reflects the adjusted dimensions. This rearrangement is performed using the rearrange function, which is likely part of a tensor manipulation library. The function also stores the temporary dimensions in an attribute named temp for potential future use.

Finally, the function returns the modified query tensor q along with the unchanged key tensor k and value tensor v. If no matching dimension is found, the original tensors are returned without modification.

This function is integral to managing tensor dimensions dynamically within a neural network context, ensuring that the input shapes align with model requirements while maintaining flexibility in processing.

**Note**: It is essential to ensure that the original_shape provided in extra_options is valid and that the maximum depth variable is appropriately defined in the context where this function is used.

**Output Example**: For an input where q has a shape of (2, 64, 32, 32), k has a shape of (2, 64, 32, 32), v has a shape of (2, 64, 32, 32), and extra_options specifies 'original_shape' as (2, 64, 32, 32), the output could be modified tensors q, k, and v with q reshaped to (2, nh * nw, h * w, c) if the conditions are met.
***
#### FunctionDef hypertile_out(out, extra_options)
**hypertile_out**: The function of hypertile_out is to rearrange the output tensor based on temporary dimensions stored in the object.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· out: A tensor that is to be rearranged based on the specified dimensions.
· extra_options: Additional options that may influence the behavior of the function (though not utilized in the current implementation).

**Code Description**: The hypertile_out function operates on a tensor named 'out' and utilizes a temporary variable 'self.temp' to determine the dimensions for rearranging the tensor. If 'self.temp' is not None, it extracts four dimensions: nh (number of horizontal tiles), nw (number of vertical tiles), h (height), and w (width). The function then sets 'self.temp' to None to prevent further use of these dimensions in subsequent calls.

The first rearrangement of the tensor 'out' is performed using the rearrange function, which reshapes the tensor from a format of "(b nh nw) hw c" to "b nh nw hw c". Here, 'b' represents the batch size, 'hw' is a combined dimension of height and width, and 'c' is the number of channels. The dimensions nh and nw are provided as parameters to the rearrangement.

Following this, a second rearrangement is executed, transforming the tensor from "b nh nw (h w) c" to "b (nh h nw w) c". This operation effectively combines the height and width dimensions into a single dimension, resulting in a new shape that reflects the tiling structure.

If 'self.temp' is None, the function simply returns the original 'out' tensor without any modifications.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that 'self.temp' is correctly set before calling this function, as its absence will lead to the function returning the input tensor unchanged. Additionally, the rearrangement operations depend on the correct interpretation of the dimensions involved.

**Output Example**: If the input tensor 'out' has a shape of (2, 4, 4, 16), and 'self.temp' is set to (2, 2, 8, 8), the output after calling hypertile_out would have a shape of (2, 2, 2, 8, 8, 16).
