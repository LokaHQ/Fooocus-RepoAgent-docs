## ClassDef LatentRebatch
**LatentRebatch**: The function of LatentRebatch is to manage and reorganize batches of latent samples for processing in a machine learning context.

**attributes**: The attributes of this Class.
· INPUT_TYPES: Defines the required input types for the class methods, specifically a dictionary containing 'latents' of type 'LATENT' and 'batch_size' of type 'INT' with constraints.
· RETURN_TYPES: Specifies the return type of the class methods, which is a tuple containing 'LATENT'.
· INPUT_IS_LIST: A boolean indicating that the input is expected to be a list.
· OUTPUT_IS_LIST: A tuple indicating that the output will also be a list.
· FUNCTION: A string that defines the name of the function, which is "rebatch".
· CATEGORY: A string that categorizes the class under "latent/batch".

**Code Description**: The LatentRebatch class is designed to facilitate the rebatching of latent samples, which are typically used in generative models. The class provides several static methods to handle the preparation and manipulation of these batches. 

The `get_batch` method prepares a batch from a list of latents, extracting samples and their corresponding noise masks. It ensures that the noise mask is appropriately sized and repeats it if necessary. The method also handles batch indices, which are crucial for tracking the original samples.

The `get_slices` method divides an indexable object into a specified number of slices, each of a defined length, returning any remainder that does not fit into a complete slice.

The `slice_batch` method applies the `get_slices` method to each element in a batch, returning a zipped list of the results, which allows for easy handling of multiple batches.

The `cat_batch` method concatenates two batches, ensuring that if one batch is None, it returns the other. It handles both tensor and non-tensor types, allowing for flexibility in the types of data being processed.

The `rebatch` method is the core functionality of the class. It processes a list of latents, organizing them into batches of a specified size. It checks for dimension mismatches and slices the current batch accordingly. If the current batch exceeds the target batch size, it slices the batch and appends the results to an output list. Finally, it cleans up the output by removing any empty noise masks.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the input latents are structured correctly, as the methods rely on specific keys and shapes within the latent data. Users should also be aware of the constraints on batch size to avoid runtime errors.

**Output Example**: A possible return value from the `rebatch` method could look like this:
```
([
    {'samples': tensor([[...], [...]]), 'noise_mask': tensor([[...], [...]]), 'batch_index': [0, 1]},
    {'samples': tensor([[...], [...]]), 'batch_index': [2, 3]}
],)
``` 
This output represents a list of dictionaries, each containing 'samples', 'noise_mask', and 'batch_index', structured for further processing in a machine learning pipeline.
### FunctionDef INPUT_TYPES(s)
**INPUT_TYPES**: The function of INPUT_TYPES is to define the required input types for a specific operation involving latent variables and batch size.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· parameter1: s - This parameter is not utilized within the function and serves as a placeholder for potential future use or for compatibility with a specific interface.

**Code Description**: The INPUT_TYPES function returns a dictionary that specifies the required input types for a particular process. The dictionary contains a single key, "required", which maps to another dictionary. This inner dictionary defines two required inputs: "latents" and "batch_size". 

- The "latents" key is associated with a tuple containing a single string "LATENT", indicating that the expected input for this parameter is of type LATENT.
- The "batch_size" key is associated with a tuple that contains the string "INT" and a second dictionary that specifies constraints on the integer value. The constraints include a default value of 1, a minimum value of 1, and a maximum value of 4096. This means that the batch size must be an integer within this range, ensuring that the function can handle a variety of batch sizes while enforcing reasonable limits.

Overall, this function is essential for validating the inputs of a process that relies on latent variables and batch sizes, ensuring that the inputs conform to the expected types and constraints.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the inputs provided to the function adhere to the specified types and constraints to avoid runtime errors. Users should be aware that the "batch_size" must always be an integer within the defined range.

**Output Example**: An example of the output returned by the INPUT_TYPES function would be:
{
    "required": {
        "latents": ("LATENT",),
        "batch_size": ("INT", {"default": 1, "min": 1, "max": 4096}),
    }
}
***
### FunctionDef get_batch(latents, list_ind, offset)
**get_batch**: The function of get_batch is to prepare a batch out of the list of latents.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· latents: A list of latent variables containing samples and potentially a noise mask.
· list_ind: An index indicating which entry in the latents list to process.
· offset: An integer value used to adjust the batch index.

**Code Description**: The get_batch function is designed to extract and prepare a batch of samples from a specified entry in a list of latents. It retrieves the 'samples' and 'noise_mask' from the latents at the given index (list_ind). If a noise mask is not provided, it defaults to a tensor of ones with the appropriate shape. The function ensures that the mask is resized to match the expected dimensions of the samples, specifically scaling it to eight times the height and width of the samples if necessary. 

Additionally, if the mask has fewer instances than the samples, it is repeated to ensure that there are enough masks to correspond to the samples. The function also checks for an existing 'batch_index' in the latents; if it is absent, it generates a default batch index based on the offset and the number of samples. Finally, the function returns the samples, the processed mask, and the batch indices.

This function is called within the rebatch method of the LatentRebatch class. In rebatch, get_batch is invoked in a loop to process each entry in the latents list. The samples and masks obtained from get_batch are used to build a current batch, which is then managed based on its dimensions relative to a specified batch size. If the dimensions of the next batch do not match the current batch, the current batch is sliced and added to the output list. This ensures that the output consists of batches that conform to the required size and structure.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the latents list contains the necessary keys ('samples' and optionally 'noise_mask') for the function to operate correctly. The function assumes that the input tensors are compatible with the operations performed, particularly regarding their shapes.

**Output Example**: A possible return value of the function could be:
(samples_tensor, mask_tensor, batch_indices_list)
Where samples_tensor is a tensor of shape (N, C, H, W), mask_tensor is a tensor of shape (N, 1, H*8, W*8), and batch_indices_list is a list of integers representing the indices of the samples in the batch.
***
### FunctionDef get_slices(indexable, num, batch_size)
**get_slices**: The function of get_slices is to divide an indexable object into a specified number of slices, each of a defined length, while also handling any remaining elements.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· parameter1: indexable - An object that can be indexed, such as a list or a string, which will be divided into slices.
· parameter2: num - An integer representing the number of slices to create from the indexable object.
· parameter3: batch_size - An integer that defines the length of each slice.

**Code Description**: The get_slices function takes an indexable object and divides it into a specified number of slices, each of a defined length (batch_size). It initializes an empty list called slices to store the resulting slices. A for loop iterates from 0 to num (exclusive), and in each iteration, it appends a slice of the indexable object to the slices list. The slice is created using Python's list slicing syntax, where the start index is calculated as i * batch_size and the end index as (i + 1) * batch_size.

After the loop, the function checks if there are any remaining elements in the indexable object that were not included in the slices. This is done by comparing the product of num and batch_size with the length of the indexable object. If there are remaining elements, the function returns the list of slices along with the remaining elements as a second return value. If there are no remaining elements, it returns the slices and None.

The get_slices function is called by the slice_batch function, which processes a batch of data. In slice_batch, get_slices is invoked for each element in the batch, effectively applying the slicing operation to each individual item. The results from get_slices are then combined using the zip function, which groups the slices together, allowing for further processing of the batched data.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the num parameter does not exceed the number of elements in the indexable object when calling this function, as this could lead to unexpected behavior or empty slices.

**Output Example**: For an indexable object like a list [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], if num is set to 3 and batch_size is set to 3, the function would return:
```
([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]], None)
``` 
If num is set to 4 and batch_size is still 3, it would return:
```
([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]], None)
``` 
In this case, since there are no remaining elements, the second part of the return value is None.
***
### FunctionDef slice_batch(batch, num, batch_size)
**slice_batch**: The function of slice_batch is to divide a batch of data into slices based on specified parameters.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· parameter1: batch - An iterable collection (such as a list or tuple) containing the data to be sliced. Each element in this collection is expected to be indexable.
· parameter2: num - An integer representing the number of slices to create from each element in the batch.
· parameter3: batch_size - An integer that defines the length of each slice.

**Code Description**: The slice_batch function processes a given batch of data by applying the get_slices function to each element within the batch. It generates a list of slices for each element, where the number of slices and their respective sizes are determined by the num and batch_size parameters. The results from get_slices are then combined using the zip function, which effectively groups the slices together, allowing for further processing of the batched data.

The slice_batch function is called within the rebatch method of the LatentRebatch class. In rebatch, slice_batch is utilized when the current batch exceeds the specified batch size. The function calculates how many slices can be created based on the current batch's size and the provided batch_size. It then calls slice_batch to obtain the sliced data, which is subsequently appended to an output list for further use.

This structured approach ensures that data is efficiently managed and processed in manageable chunks, which is particularly important in scenarios involving large datasets or when working with machine learning models that require data to be fed in batches.

**Note**: It is essential to ensure that the num parameter does not exceed the number of elements in the indexable objects within the batch to avoid unexpected behavior or empty slices. Additionally, the batch_size should be chosen carefully to ensure that the resulting slices are meaningful and usable in the context of the application.

**Output Example**: For a batch containing indexable objects such as [[1, 2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7, 8]], if num is set to 2 and batch_size is set to 2, the function would return:
```
[([1, 2], [5, 6]), ([3, 4], [7, 8])]
``` 
This output indicates that each element in the batch has been sliced into two parts, with each part containing two elements.
***
### FunctionDef cat_batch(batch1, batch2)
**cat_batch**: The function of cat_batch is to concatenate two batches of data element-wise, handling cases where the first batch may be None.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· parameter1: batch1 - The first batch of data, which can be a list of tensors or None.
· parameter2: batch2 - The second batch of data, which is expected to be a list of tensors.

**Code Description**: The cat_batch function is designed to merge two batches of data, batch1 and batch2, by concatenating their corresponding elements. If the first batch (batch1) is None, the function simply returns the second batch (batch2). For each pair of elements from batch1 and batch2, the function checks if the element from batch1 is a tensor. If it is, it concatenates the two tensors using the torch.cat function. If the element from batch1 is not a tensor, it assumes that both elements are compatible for addition and performs the addition instead. The result is a new list containing the concatenated or added elements.

This function is called within the rebatch method of the LatentRebatch class. In the rebatch method, cat_batch is used to combine the current batch of data with the next batch fetched from a dataset. The rebatch method manages the flow of data, ensuring that batches are concatenated only when their dimensions match. If the dimensions do not match, it slices the current batch and appends it to an output list before updating the current batch with the new data. The cat_batch function plays a crucial role in this process, allowing for the dynamic combination of batches as they are processed.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the elements in both batches are compatible for concatenation or addition. The function assumes that if the elements are not tensors, they can be added together without any issues.

**Output Example**: An example of the return value when calling cat_batch with two batches could be:
```python
batch1 = [torch.tensor([[1, 2], [3, 4]]), torch.tensor([[5, 6]])]
batch2 = [torch.tensor([[7, 8], [9, 10]]), torch.tensor([[11, 12]])]
result = cat_batch(batch1, batch2)
# result would be: [tensor([[1, 2], [3, 4], [7, 8], [9, 10]]), tensor([[5, 6], [11, 12]])]
```
***
### FunctionDef rebatch(self, latents, batch_size)
**rebatch**: The function of rebatch is to reorganize and manage batches of latent variables based on a specified batch size.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· latents: A list of latent variables that contain samples, noise masks, and batch indices.
· batch_size: A tuple where the first element specifies the target size for each batch.

**Code Description**: The rebatch function is responsible for processing a list of latent variables and organizing them into batches that conform to a specified size. It begins by extracting the first element of the batch_size tuple to determine the target batch size. The function initializes an empty list, output_list, to store the resulting batches and a variable, current_batch, to hold the currently processed batch.

The function iterates through the latents list, invoking the get_batch method to fetch the next batch of samples, masks, and indices. The processed count is updated based on the number of indices retrieved. If current_batch is None, it is set to the next_batch. If the dimensions of next_batch do not match those of current_batch, the current batch is sliced using the slice_batch method and added to output_list. If the dimensions match, the two batches are concatenated using the cat_batch method.

When the size of current_batch exceeds the target batch size, it is sliced into smaller batches, and each slice is appended to output_list. Finally, if there are any remaining samples in current_batch after the loop, they are also sliced and added to output_list. The function concludes by removing any entries in output_list that have noise masks filled with ones, indicating they are empty, and returns the output_list as a single-element tuple.

The rebatch function interacts closely with the get_batch, slice_batch, and cat_batch methods. The get_batch method is called to retrieve batches of data from the latents list, while slice_batch and cat_batch are used to manage the sizes and combinations of these batches. This structured approach ensures that the data is efficiently processed and organized into manageable sizes, which is crucial for applications such as machine learning where data is often handled in batches.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the latents list contains the necessary keys ('samples' and optionally 'noise_mask') for the function to operate correctly. Additionally, the function assumes that the input tensors are compatible with the operations performed, particularly regarding their shapes.

**Output Example**: A possible return value of the function could be:
```python
[{'samples': samples_tensor1, 'noise_mask': mask_tensor1, 'batch_index': batch_indices_list1}, 
 {'samples': samples_tensor2, 'batch_index': batch_indices_list2}]
```
Where samples_tensor1 and samples_tensor2 are tensors of shape (N, C, H, W), mask_tensor1 is a tensor of shape (N, 1, H*8, W*8), and batch_indices_list1 and batch_indices_list2 are lists of integers representing the indices of the samples in the respective batches.

## ClassDef ImageRebatch
**ImageRebatch**: The function of ImageRebatch is to reorganize a list of images into batches of a specified size.

**attributes**: The attributes of this Class.
· INPUT_TYPES: Defines the required input types for the class method, including images and batch size.  
· RETURN_TYPES: Specifies the type of output returned by the class method, which is a list of images.  
· INPUT_IS_LIST: Indicates that the input is expected to be a list.  
· OUTPUT_IS_LIST: Specifies that the output will also be a list.  
· FUNCTION: The name of the function that performs the main operation, which is "rebatch".  
· CATEGORY: Categorizes the function under "image/batch".

**Code Description**: The ImageRebatch class is designed to handle the batching of images for processing. It contains a class method `INPUT_TYPES` that specifies the required inputs: a list of images and an integer representing the batch size. The batch size must be between 1 and 4096, with a default value of 1. The class also defines the return type as a list of images. 

The core functionality is implemented in the `rebatch` method, which takes two parameters: `images` and `batch_size`. The method begins by extracting the first element from the batch_size list, as it is expected to be a single integer. It initializes two lists: `output_list` to store the final batched images and `all_images` to hold individual image slices.

The method iterates through each image in the input list, slicing each image into individual components along the first dimension. These components are appended to the `all_images` list. After gathering all individual image slices, the method then groups these slices into batches based on the specified batch size. It uses the `torch.cat` function to concatenate the slices along the specified dimension and appends each concatenated batch to the `output_list`.

Finally, the method returns a tuple containing the `output_list`, which consists of the batched images.

**Note**: When using this class, ensure that the input images are in a compatible format and that the batch size is within the defined limits. The input images should be structured in a way that allows for slicing along the first dimension.

**Output Example**: If the input consists of three images, each with a shape of (4, 3, 256, 256) (representing 4 images of 3 channels with a resolution of 256x256), and the batch size is set to 2, the output will be a list containing two batched images, each with a shape of (2, 3, 256, 256). The output might look like this:
```
[
    tensor([[[...], [...], [...]], [[...], [...], [...]]]),  # Batch 1
    tensor([[[...], [...], [...]], [[...], [...], [...]]])   # Batch 2
]
```
### FunctionDef INPUT_TYPES(s)
**INPUT_TYPES**: The function of INPUT_TYPES is to define the required input types for a specific operation involving images and batch size.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· s: This parameter is not utilized within the function body and serves as a placeholder for potential future use or for compatibility with a specific interface.

**Code Description**: The INPUT_TYPES function returns a dictionary that specifies the required input types for processing images in batches. The dictionary contains a single key, "required", which maps to another dictionary detailing the specific inputs needed. 

Within this inner dictionary:
- The key "images" is associated with a tuple containing the string "IMAGE". This indicates that the function expects an input of type IMAGE, which typically refers to image data that the function will process.
- The key "batch_size" is associated with a tuple that includes the string "INT" and a second dictionary that defines constraints on the integer input. This dictionary specifies that the default value for batch_size is 1, with a minimum allowable value of 1 and a maximum allowable value of 4096. This means that the function can accept integer inputs for batch size within this specified range.

The structure of the return value is designed to enforce type checking and input validation, ensuring that the function receives the correct types and values for its operation.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the inputs provided to the function adhere to the specified types and constraints to avoid runtime errors. Users should be aware of the maximum batch size limit when configuring their input.

**Output Example**: A possible appearance of the code's return value could be:
{
    "required": {
        "images": ("IMAGE",),
        "batch_size": ("INT", {"default": 1, "min": 1, "max": 4096})
    }
}
***
### FunctionDef rebatch(self, images, batch_size)
**rebatch**: The function of rebatch is to reorganize a list of image tensors into batches of a specified size.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· images: A list of image tensors, where each tensor can have multiple images stacked along the first dimension.
· batch_size: A tuple containing a single integer that specifies the desired size of each batch.

**Code Description**: The rebatch function takes a list of image tensors and a batch size as input. It first extracts the batch size from the provided tuple, assuming it contains only one element. The function initializes two lists: output_list to store the final batched tensors and all_images to hold individual image slices. 

The function iterates over each image tensor in the input list. For each tensor, it further iterates through the first dimension (which represents the number of images) and appends each individual image (sliced to maintain its dimensionality) to the all_images list. 

Once all images are collected, the function groups them into batches. It does this by iterating over the all_images list in steps defined by the batch size. For each step, it concatenates the appropriate number of images along the first dimension (dim=0) and appends the resulting tensor to the output_list. 

Finally, the function returns a tuple containing the output_list, which consists of the batched image tensors.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the batch size is appropriate for the number of images available. If the total number of images is not a multiple of the batch size, the last batch may contain fewer images than specified.

**Output Example**: If the input images contain 8 tensors of shape (3, 224, 224) and the batch size is (4,), the output might look like:
(
  tensor([[...], [...], [...], [...]]),  # Batch 1
  tensor([[...], [...], [...], [...]]),  # Batch 2
  tensor([[...], [...], [...], [...]]),  # Batch 3
  tensor([[...], [...], [...], [...]]),  # Batch 4
) 
Each tensor in the output represents a batch of images concatenated along the first dimension.
