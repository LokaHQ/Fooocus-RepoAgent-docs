## FunctionDef Fourier_filter(x, threshold, scale)
**Fourier_filter**: The function of Fourier_filter is to apply a Fourier transform-based filtering to a given tensor.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· parameter1: x - A tensor of input data that will be filtered. It is expected to be of shape (B, C, H, W), where B is the batch size, C is the number of channels, H is the height, and W is the width of the input tensor.  
· parameter2: threshold - An integer that defines the size of the central region in the frequency domain that will be scaled.  
· parameter3: scale - A float that determines the scaling factor applied to the specified frequency region.

**Code Description**: The Fourier_filter function performs the following operations:
1. It first computes the N-dimensional Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) of the input tensor `x` using `torch.fft.fftn`, which transforms the tensor into the frequency domain.
2. The frequency representation is then shifted using `torch.fft.fftshift` to center the zero frequency component.
3. A mask tensor of ones is created with the same shape as the frequency representation. The mask is then modified to scale a central region defined by the `threshold` parameter. This central region is set to the value of `scale`, effectively allowing for selective filtering in the frequency domain.
4. The modified frequency representation is then transformed back to the spatial domain using the inverse FFT (`torch.fft.ifftn`) after shifting it back with `torch.fft.ifftshift`.
5. Finally, the filtered output tensor is returned, converted back to the original data type of the input tensor.

The Fourier_filter function is called within the output_block_patch functions of two different modules: FreeU and FreeU_V2. In both cases, it is used to apply frequency domain filtering to the tensor `hsp`, which is a part of the processing pipeline. The function is invoked conditionally based on the presence of a scaling factor in the `scale_dict`, and it handles potential device compatibility issues by attempting to run on the original device and falling back to CPU if necessary.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the input tensor `x` is compatible with the FFT operations, and that the device supports the required torch.fft functions. The threshold and scale parameters should be chosen carefully to achieve the desired filtering effect.

**Output Example**: A possible appearance of the code's return value could be a tensor of the same shape as the input tensor, containing filtered values that reflect the modifications made in the frequency domain. For instance, if the input tensor `x` had a shape of (2, 3, 64, 64), the output would also have a shape of (2, 3, 64, 64) with real-valued entries representing the filtered data.
## ClassDef FreeU
**FreeU**: The function of FreeU is to apply a patch to a model using specified scaling and shifting parameters.

**attributes**: The attributes of this Class.
· INPUT_TYPES: Defines the required input types for the patch method, including model and various float parameters.  
· RETURN_TYPES: Specifies the return type of the patch method, which is a model.  
· FUNCTION: Indicates the name of the method that performs the patch operation.  
· CATEGORY: Categorizes this class under "model_patches".

**Code Description**: The FreeU class is designed to modify a given model by applying a patch that adjusts the model's output based on specified parameters. The class includes a class method, INPUT_TYPES, which outlines the required inputs for the patch method. These inputs include a model and four floating-point parameters (b1, b2, s1, s2) that control the scaling and shifting of the model's output. Each of these parameters has defined default values, minimum and maximum limits, and step increments.

The RETURN_TYPES attribute indicates that the output of the patch method will be a modified model. The FUNCTION attribute specifies that the core functionality of this class is encapsulated in the "patch" method. The CATEGORY attribute classifies this class within the broader context of model patches.

The patch method itself takes the model and the four parameters as inputs. It first retrieves the number of channels from the model's configuration. A scale dictionary is created to map specific channel sizes to their corresponding scaling and shifting values. The method defines an inner function, output_block_patch, which applies the scaling and shifting based on the input parameters. This inner function checks the shape of the input tensor and applies the appropriate scaling. If the input tensor is on a non-CPU device, it attempts to apply a Fourier filter to the tensor, handling any exceptions that may arise by switching to CPU processing if necessary.

Finally, the method clones the original model, sets the output block patch function to the cloned model, and returns the modified model as a tuple.

**Note**: When using the FreeU class, ensure that the model being patched is compatible with the expected input shapes and that the specified parameters are within the defined ranges to avoid runtime errors.

**Output Example**: A possible return value from the patch method could be a modified model object that has been adjusted according to the specified parameters, represented as a tuple: (modified_model_instance,).
### FunctionDef INPUT_TYPES(s)
**INPUT_TYPES**: The function of INPUT_TYPES is to define and return a dictionary that specifies the required input types and their constraints for a model.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· parameter1: s - This parameter is a placeholder and is not used within the function body.

**Code Description**: The INPUT_TYPES function constructs and returns a dictionary that outlines the required input types for a specific model. The dictionary contains a single key, "required", which maps to another dictionary. This inner dictionary specifies five input parameters: "model", "b1", "b2", "s1", and "s2". Each of these parameters is associated with a tuple that defines the type of the parameter and, in the case of "b1", "b2", "s1", and "s2", additional constraints such as default values, minimum and maximum allowable values, and the step size for increments.

- "model" is expected to be of type "MODEL", which indicates that it is likely a predefined type or class within the broader context of the application.
- "b1", "b2", "s1", and "s2" are all of type "FLOAT", and each has specific constraints:
  - "b1" has a default value of 1.1, with a minimum of 0.0, a maximum of 10.0, and a step size of 0.01.
  - "b2" has a default value of 1.2, with the same constraints as "b1".
  - "s1" has a default value of 0.9, with identical constraints.
  - "s2" has a default value of 0.2, also with the same constraints.

This structured approach allows for clear definition and validation of input parameters, ensuring that the model receives the appropriate data types and values.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the input values provided to the model adhere to the specified constraints to avoid errors during execution. The function is designed to facilitate the validation process by clearly defining the expected input types and their respective limits.

**Output Example**: A possible appearance of the code's return value could be:
{
    "required": {
        "model": ("MODEL",),
        "b1": ("FLOAT", {"default": 1.1, "min": 0.0, "max": 10.0, "step": 0.01}),
        "b2": ("FLOAT", {"default": 1.2, "min": 0.0, "max": 10.0, "step": 0.01}),
        "s1": ("FLOAT", {"default": 0.9, "min": 0.0, "max": 10.0, "step": 0.01}),
        "s2": ("FLOAT", {"default": 0.2, "min": 0.0, "max": 10.0, "step": 0.01}),
    }
}

### FunctionDef patch(self, model, b1, b2, s1, s2)
**patch**: The function of patch is to modify the model's output block by applying a Fourier filter based on the model's configuration and specified scaling parameters.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· model: The model object that contains the configuration and structure for the output block patching.
· b1: A scaling factor for the first block of the model.
· b2: A scaling factor for the second block of the model.
· s1: A secondary scaling factor associated with b1.
· s2: A secondary scaling factor associated with b2.

**Code Description**: The patch function begins by extracting the number of channels from the model's configuration. It then creates a dictionary, scale_dict, that maps specific channel counts to their corresponding scaling factors (b1, s1) and (b2, s2). The function initializes an empty dictionary, on_cpu_devices, to track devices that do not support certain operations.

Within the patch function, a nested function named output_block_patch is defined. This function takes three parameters: h, hsp, and transformer_options. It retrieves the scaling factors from scale_dict based on the shape of the input tensor h. If a valid scale is found, it modifies the first half of the tensor h by multiplying it with the first scaling factor. 

The function then checks if the device of hsp is already recorded in on_cpu_devices. If not, it attempts to apply a Fourier filter to hsp. If the device does not support the required FFT functions, it catches the exception, logs a message, and switches the tensor to the CPU for processing before returning it to its original device. If the device is already noted as unsupported, it directly applies the Fourier filter after moving hsp to the CPU.

Finally, the patch function clones the input model, sets the output block patching function to the cloned model, and returns the modified model as a tuple.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the model passed to the patch function is compatible with the expected configuration. Additionally, the function assumes that the Fourier_filter is defined elsewhere in the codebase and is capable of handling the specified parameters.

**Output Example**: The return value of the patch function would be a tuple containing the modified model, which could look like this: (ModifiedModelObject,).
#### FunctionDef output_block_patch(h, hsp, transformer_options)
**output_block_patch**: The function of output_block_patch is to apply scaling and Fourier filtering to input tensors based on their device compatibility.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· parameter1: h - A tensor that represents the input data, which will be modified based on the scaling factor derived from its shape.  
· parameter2: hsp - A tensor that will undergo Fourier filtering, expected to be compatible with the operations defined within the function.  
· parameter3: transformer_options - A dictionary or object containing options for the transformer, though it is not explicitly used in the function's current implementation.

**Code Description**: The output_block_patch function begins by determining a scaling factor from a predefined dictionary, scale_dict, based on the second dimension of the input tensor h. If a valid scale is found, the function modifies the first half of the tensor h by multiplying it with the corresponding scale factor. 

Next, the function checks the device on which the tensor hsp resides. If hsp is not on a CPU device, it attempts to apply the Fourier_filter function to hsp, passing a threshold of 1 and the second scaling factor from the scale. The Fourier_filter function is designed to perform frequency domain filtering on the input tensor, which involves applying a Fourier transform, modifying the frequency representation, and then transforming it back to the spatial domain.

If the device does not support the necessary FFT functions, the function catches the exception and prints a message indicating the device's incompatibility. It then switches the tensor hsp to the CPU, applies the Fourier_filter function, and returns the result back to the original device. If hsp is already on a CPU device, it directly applies the Fourier_filter function without any device switching.

The output_block_patch function ultimately returns the modified tensor h and the filtered tensor hsp. This function is critical in ensuring that the tensors are appropriately processed based on their device capabilities, while also applying necessary transformations to the data.

**Note**: It is essential to ensure that the input tensors h and hsp are compatible with the operations performed within the function. The scale_dict must be properly defined to provide valid scaling factors, and the device compatibility should be verified to avoid runtime errors during the Fourier filtering process.

**Output Example**: A possible appearance of the code's return value could be two tensors: the first tensor h modified with scaling applied to its first half, and the second tensor hsp filtered in the frequency domain, both retaining their original shapes. For instance, if h had a shape of (2, 3, 64, 64) and hsp had a shape of (2, 3, 64, 64), the output would consist of two tensors of the same shapes, with h reflecting the scaling and hsp containing the filtered data.

## ClassDef FreeU_V2
**FreeU_V2**: The function of FreeU_V2 is to apply a patch to a model, modifying its output based on specified parameters.

**attributes**: The attributes of this Class.
· INPUT_TYPES: A class method that defines the required input types for the patch function, including model and several float parameters with specified ranges and defaults.  
· RETURN_TYPES: A tuple indicating the type of output returned by the patch function, which is a model.  
· FUNCTION: A string that specifies the name of the function to be executed, which is "patch".  
· CATEGORY: A string that categorizes this class under "model_patches".

**Code Description**: The FreeU_V2 class is designed to modify a machine learning model by applying a patch that adjusts the model's output based on input parameters. The class method INPUT_TYPES specifies the required inputs for the patch function, which include a model and four float parameters (b1, b2, s1, s2) that control the scaling and shifting of the model's output. Each float parameter has a default value and constraints on its range, ensuring that users provide valid inputs.

The patch method itself takes the model and the four float parameters as arguments. It retrieves the number of channels from the model's configuration and constructs a scale dictionary that maps specific channel sizes to their corresponding scaling and shifting values. The method defines an internal function, output_block_patch, which applies the scaling and Fourier filtering to the model's output based on the input parameters.

The output_block_patch function computes the mean, maximum, and minimum values of the model's hidden states, normalizes these values, and applies the specified scaling to the first half of the hidden states. It also attempts to apply a Fourier filter to the second half of the hidden states, handling potential device compatibility issues by falling back to CPU processing if necessary.

Finally, the patch method clones the original model, sets the output block patch function, and returns the modified model. This class is likely called from other parts of the project, such as modules/core.py, where it may be used to enhance or modify models for specific tasks, ensuring that the models can adapt to different requirements based on the provided parameters.

**Note**: Users should ensure that the input parameters are within the specified ranges to avoid runtime errors. Additionally, the class relies on the presence of the Fourier_filter function, which must be compatible with the device being used.

**Output Example**: A possible return value from the patch method could be a modified model object that has been adjusted according to the specified parameters, ready for further use in a machine learning pipeline.
### FunctionDef INPUT_TYPES(s)
**INPUT_TYPES**: The function of INPUT_TYPES is to define and return a dictionary that specifies the required input types and their constraints for a model.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· parameter1: s - This parameter is not utilized within the function and serves as a placeholder.

**Code Description**: The INPUT_TYPES function constructs and returns a dictionary that outlines the required input parameters for a specific model. The dictionary contains a single key, "required", which maps to another dictionary that specifies five input parameters: "model", "b1", "b2", "s1", and "s2".

  - "min": This indicates the minimum allowable value for the parameter.
  - "max": This indicates the maximum allowable value for the parameter.
  - "step": This defines the increment step size for the parameter, which is useful for input validation and user interface controls.

The specific values for the parameters are as follows:
- "b1": default value of 1.3, with a range from 0.0 to 10.0 and a step of 0.01.
- "b2": default value of 1.4, with a range from 0.0 to 10.0 and a step of 0.01.
- "s1": default value of 0.9, with a range from 0.0 to 10.0 and a step of 0.01.
- "s2": default value of 0.2, with a range from 0.0 to 10.0 and a step of 0.01.

This structured approach allows for clear validation of input parameters, ensuring that users provide values that are within the specified constraints.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the input values provided by the user adhere to the defined constraints to avoid errors during model execution. The function does not perform any validation itself; it merely defines the expected structure and constraints.

**Output Example**: A possible appearance of the code's return value could be:
{
    "required": {
        "model": ("MODEL",),
        "b1": ("FLOAT", {"default": 1.3, "min": 0.0, "max": 10.0, "step": 0.01}),

### FunctionDef patch(self, model, b1, b2, s1, s2)
**patch**: The function of patch is to modify the model's output block by applying specific transformations based on the input parameters.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· parameter1: model - The model object that is to be patched with new output block functionality.  
· parameter2: b1 - A scaling factor used in the transformation of the model's hidden states.  
· parameter3: b2 - Another scaling factor used in conjunction with b1 for the model's hidden states.  
· parameter4: s1 - A secondary scaling factor that influences the Fourier filtering process.  
· parameter5: s2 - Another secondary scaling factor used in the Fourier filtering process.

**Code Description**: The patch function is designed to enhance the output processing of a given model by applying a custom transformation to its hidden states. It begins by retrieving the number of channels in the model's configuration. A dictionary is created to map specific channel sizes to their corresponding scaling factors. 

The function defines an inner function, output_block_patch, which is responsible for processing the hidden states (h) and the hidden state projections (hsp). This inner function checks the shape of the hidden states to determine the appropriate scaling factors. It computes the mean, maximum, and minimum values of the hidden states, normalizes these values, and applies a scaling transformation to the first half of the hidden states based on the calculated mean.

Furthermore, the function attempts to apply a Fourier filter to the hidden state projections. If the device of the hidden state projections does not support the necessary FFT functions, it falls back to using the CPU for processing. 

Finally, the original model is cloned, and the modified output block patch function is set on the cloned model. The function returns the modified model as a single-element tuple.

This function is called by the apply_freeu function, which serves as a wrapper to invoke the patch function with the same parameters. The apply_freeu function returns the first element of the tuple produced by patch, which is the modified model. This relationship indicates that apply_freeu is a higher-level function that simplifies the process of applying the patch to the model, making it easier for users to integrate the patch functionality without directly interacting with the patch function.

**Note**: When using this function, ensure that the model passed as a parameter is compatible with the expected configurations, particularly regarding the number of channels and device capabilities for Fourier transformations.

**Output Example**: A possible return value of the patch function would be a modified model object that has a new output block processing capability, allowing for enhanced transformations of the hidden states based on the specified scaling factors.
#### FunctionDef output_block_patch(h, hsp, transformer_options)
**output_block_patch**: The function of output_block_patch is to apply scaling and Fourier-based filtering to the input tensors based on their dimensions and device compatibility.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· parameter1: h - A tensor representing hidden states, expected to have a shape of (B, C, H, W), where B is the batch size, C is the number of channels, H is the height, and W is the width.  
· parameter2: hsp - A tensor that will undergo Fourier filtering, also expected to have a shape of (B, C, H, W).  
· parameter3: transformer_options - A dictionary or object containing options for the transformer, which may include scaling factors and other configurations.

**Code Description**: The output_block_patch function begins by retrieving a scaling factor from a predefined dictionary (scale_dict) based on the second dimension of the input tensor `h`. If a valid scale is found, the function proceeds to compute the mean, maximum, and minimum values of the hidden states across the first dimension (batch dimension). The mean is normalized to a range between 0 and 1 using the maximum and minimum values, which allows for consistent scaling across different batches.

Subsequently, the first half of the tensor `h` is scaled using the computed hidden mean and the retrieved scale factor. This operation modifies the values in `h` to enhance the representation based on the calculated mean.

The function then checks the device of the tensor `hsp`. If it is not on a CPU-compatible device, it attempts to apply the Fourier_filter function to `hsp` with a specified threshold and scale. If the device does not support the required FFT operations, the function catches the exception and switches to CPU for processing, ensuring that the filtering operation can still be performed. If the device is compatible, the Fourier_filter is applied directly.

The Fourier_filter function is crucial in this context as it performs frequency domain filtering on the tensor `hsp`, allowing for selective enhancement of certain frequency components. This is particularly useful in scenarios where noise reduction or feature enhancement is desired.

Finally, the function returns the modified tensors `h` and `hsp`, which reflect the applied scaling and filtering operations.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the input tensors `h` and `hsp` are compatible with the operations performed, particularly regarding their shapes and the device capabilities. The scaling factors and threshold values should be chosen carefully to achieve the desired effects without introducing artifacts.

**Output Example**: A possible appearance of the code's return value could be two tensors of the same shape as the input tensors, where `h` contains scaled hidden states and `hsp` contains filtered values that reflect the modifications made in the frequency domain. For instance, if the input tensors `h` and `hsp` had a shape of (2, 3, 64, 64), the output would also have a shape of (2, 3, 64, 64) with real-valued entries representing the processed data.
