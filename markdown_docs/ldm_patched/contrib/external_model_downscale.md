## ClassDef PatchModelAddDownscale
**PatchModelAddDownscale**: The function of PatchModelAddDownscale is to modify a model by applying downscaling and upscaling techniques based on specified parameters.

**attributes**: The attributes of this Class.
· upscale_methods: A list of available methods for upscaling, which includes "bicubic", "nearest-exact", "bilinear", "area", and "bislerp".

**Code Description**: The PatchModelAddDownscale class is designed to facilitate the downscaling and upscaling of models in a structured manner. It provides a class method, INPUT_TYPES, which defines the required input parameters for the patching process. These parameters include:
- model: The model to be modified.
- block_number: An integer that specifies which block of the model to target, with a default value of 3 and a range from 1 to 32.
- downscale_factor: A floating-point number that determines the factor by which the model will be downscaled, with a default of 2.0 and a range from 0.1 to 9.0.
- start_percent: A floating-point number indicating the starting percentage for sigma calculation, defaulting to 0.0 and ranging from 0.0 to 1.0.
- end_percent: A floating-point number indicating the ending percentage for sigma calculation, defaulting to 0.35 and ranging from 0.0 to 1.0.
- downscale_after_skip: A boolean that specifies whether to apply downscaling after skipping, defaulting to True.
- downscale_method: A selection from the predefined upscale_methods for downscaling.
- upscale_method: A selection from the predefined upscale_methods for upscaling.

The class also defines a RETURN_TYPES attribute, which indicates that the output of the patch method will be a modified model. The FUNCTION attribute specifies that the main operation of this class is encapsulated in the "patch" method.

The patch method itself performs the following operations:
1. It calculates the sigma values for the start and end percentages using the model's sampling method.
2. It defines two inner functions, input_block_patch and output_block_patch, which handle the modification of the model's input and output blocks respectively.
   - The input_block_patch function checks if the current block matches the specified block number and applies downscaling if the sigma value is within the defined range.
   - The output_block_patch function checks if the dimensions of the output tensor differ from the expected shape and applies upscaling accordingly.
3. A clone of the original model is created, and the appropriate patch functions are set based on the downscale_after_skip parameter.
4. Finally, the modified model is returned as a tuple.

**Note**: When using this class, ensure that the input parameters are within the specified ranges to avoid runtime errors. The downscale and upscale methods should be chosen based on the desired quality and performance requirements.

**Output Example**: A possible return value from the patch method could be a modified model object that has undergone the specified downscaling and upscaling processes, represented as a tuple containing the model instance. For example: (modified_model_instance,)
### FunctionDef INPUT_TYPES(s)
**INPUT_TYPES**: The function of INPUT_TYPES is to define and return the required input types for a specific model configuration.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· s: An instance or object that contains the necessary attributes, particularly `upscale_methods`, which are used to define the input types.

**Code Description**: The INPUT_TYPES function constructs a dictionary that specifies the required input types for a model. The returned dictionary contains a single key, "required", which maps to another dictionary detailing the various parameters needed for the model configuration. Each parameter is associated with a tuple that defines its type and additional constraints. 

The parameters included are:
- "model": This parameter expects a value of type "MODEL".
- "block_number": This parameter is of type "INT" and has a default value of 3. It is constrained to be between 1 and 32, with a step increment of 1.
- "downscale_factor": This parameter is of type "FLOAT" with a default value of 2.0. It must be within the range of 0.1 to 9.0, with a precision of 0.001.
- "start_percent": This parameter is also of type "FLOAT", defaulting to 0.0, and must be between 0.0 and 1.0, with a step of 0.001.
- "end_percent": Similar to "start_percent", this is a "FLOAT" type with a default of 0.35, constrained between 0.0 and 1.0, with a step of 0.001.
- "downscale_after_skip": This parameter is of type "BOOLEAN" and defaults to True.
- "downscale_method" and "upscale_method": Both parameters reference `s.upscale_methods`, which implies that they are expected to be defined within the context of the object `s`.

This structured approach ensures that all necessary inputs are clearly defined, along with their types and constraints, facilitating proper configuration of the model.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the values provided for each parameter adhere to the specified constraints to avoid errors during model execution. The function assumes that the `s` object is correctly instantiated and contains the required attributes.

**Output Example**: A possible appearance of the code's return value could be:
{
    "required": {
        "model": ("MODEL",),
        "block_number": ("INT", {"default": 3, "min": 1, "max": 32, "step": 1}),
        "downscale_factor": ("FLOAT", {"default": 2.0, "min": 0.1, "max": 9.0, "step": 0.001}),
        "start_percent": ("FLOAT", {"default": 0.0, "min": 0.0, "max": 1.0, "step": 0.001}),
        "end_percent": ("FLOAT", {"default": 0.35, "min": 0.0, "max": 1.0, "step": 0.001}),
        "downscale_after_skip": ("BOOLEAN", {"default": True}),
        "downscale_method": (s.upscale_methods,),
        "upscale_method": (s.upscale_methods,)
    }
}

### FunctionDef patch(self, model, block_number, downscale_factor, start_percent, end_percent, downscale_after_skip, downscale_method, upscale_method)
**patch**: The function of patch is to modify a model by applying downscaling and upscaling transformations to specific input and output blocks based on defined parameters.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· model: The model object that is to be patched with downscaling and upscaling functionalities.  
· block_number: An integer representing the specific block in the model that will be targeted for patching.  
· downscale_factor: A float that determines the factor by which the input block will be downscaled.  
· start_percent: A float indicating the starting percentage for sigma values, used to determine the range for applying the downscale.  
· end_percent: A float indicating the ending percentage for sigma values, used to determine the range for applying the downscale.  
· downscale_after_skip: A boolean that specifies whether the downscaling should occur after a skip operation.  
· downscale_method: A string that defines the method to be used for downscaling the input block.  
· upscale_method: A string that defines the method to be used for upscaling the output block.

**Code Description**: The patch function begins by converting the provided start and end percentages into sigma values using the model's sampling method. It then defines two inner functions: input_block_patch and output_block_patch. 

The input_block_patch function checks if the current block being processed matches the specified block_number. If it does, it retrieves the current sigma value and checks if it falls within the range defined by sigma_start and sigma_end. If the condition is met, it applies the downscaling transformation to the input tensor using the common_upscale utility function, adjusting its dimensions based on the downscale_factor and the specified downscale_method.

The output_block_patch function checks if the spatial dimensions of the output tensor differ from those of the hidden state tensor (hsp). If they do not match, it applies the upscale transformation to the output tensor, resizing it to match the dimensions of the hidden state tensor using the specified upscale_method.

After defining these inner functions, the patch function clones the original model and sets the appropriate input and output block patching methods based on the downscale_after_skip parameter. Finally, it returns the modified model as a single-element tuple.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the downscale_factor, start_percent, and end_percent are set appropriately to avoid unintended transformations. The downscale_method and upscale_method should also be compatible with the model's architecture to ensure proper functionality.

**Output Example**: The return value of the patch function would be a tuple containing the modified model, which has the input and output block patching methods applied. For instance, the output could look like: (modified_model_instance,) where modified_model_instance is the patched version of the original model.
#### FunctionDef input_block_patch(h, transformer_options)
**input_block_patch**: The function of input_block_patch is to conditionally upscale an input tensor based on specified transformer options and a defined block number.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· h: A tensor representing the input data that may be upscaled.  
· transformer_options: A dictionary containing configuration options for the transformer, including block information and sigma values.

**Code Description**: The input_block_patch function begins by checking if the second element of the "block" key in the transformer_options dictionary matches a predefined block_number. If this condition is satisfied, the function retrieves the first sigma value from the "sigmas" key in the transformer_options and checks if it falls within a specified range defined by sigma_start and sigma_end. 

If the sigma value meets the criteria (i.e., it is less than or equal to sigma_start and greater than or equal to sigma_end), the function proceeds to upscale the input tensor h. This is accomplished by calling the common_upscale function from the ldm_patched.modules.utils module. The common_upscale function is designed to resize a batch of image samples to specified dimensions using a chosen interpolation method, which is determined by the downscale_factor and downscale_method parameters.

The upscaling process involves calculating the new dimensions for the height and width of the tensor h based on the downscale_factor. The function then returns the potentially modified tensor h, which may have been upscaled if the conditions were met.

This function is integral to the processing pipeline where image tensors are manipulated based on their sigma values and block configurations, ensuring that only relevant tensors are upscaled for further processing.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the transformer_options dictionary contains the necessary keys and that the input tensor h is in the correct shape and data type before invoking the input_block_patch function.

**Output Example**: Given an input tensor h of shape (1, 3, 64, 64) and appropriate transformer_options that meet the conditions, calling input_block_patch would return an upscaled tensor, potentially of shape (1, 3, 128, 128), depending on the downscale_factor and the specified upscaling method.
***
#### FunctionDef output_block_patch(h, hsp, transformer_options)
**output_block_patch**: The function of output_block_patch is to adjust the dimensions of a tensor representing image data to match those of a specified target tensor, using an upscaling method if necessary.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· h: A tensor of shape (N, C, H, W) representing a batch of images, where N is the number of samples, C is the number of channels, H is the height, and W is the width.  
· hsp: A tensor of shape (N, C, Hsp, Wsp) representing the target dimensions to which the input tensor h should be adjusted.  
· transformer_options: A dictionary containing options for the transformer, although it is not utilized within the current implementation of the function.

**Code Description**: The output_block_patch function begins by checking if the width (h.shape[2]) of the input tensor h does not match the width (hsp.shape[2]) of the target tensor hsp. If the dimensions are different, it calls the common_upscale function from the ldm_patched.modules.utils module to upscale the input tensor h to the target dimensions specified by hsp. The common_upscale function takes the input tensor h and the target dimensions (width and height) derived from hsp, along with an upscale method and a cropping strategy, which are not explicitly defined in the output_block_patch function but are assumed to be set elsewhere in the code.

The output of the common_upscale function is then returned along with the original target tensor hsp. This modular approach allows for flexibility in handling image data, ensuring that the input tensor is appropriately resized before further processing. The output_block_patch function is likely called within a larger context where image data needs to be aligned with specific dimensions for subsequent operations, such as feeding into a neural network or performing additional transformations.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the input tensor h and the target tensor hsp are correctly shaped and compatible before invoking the output_block_patch function. The function assumes that the input tensor h is a 4-dimensional tensor representing a batch of images.

**Output Example**: Given an input tensor h of shape (1, 3, 4, 4) and a target tensor hsp of shape (1, 3, 8, 8), calling output_block_patch would return a resized tensor h of shape (1, 3, 8, 8) along with the original hsp tensor.
