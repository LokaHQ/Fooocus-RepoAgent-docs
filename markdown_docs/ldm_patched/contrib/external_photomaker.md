## ClassDef MLP
**MLP**: The function of MLP is to implement a multi-layer perceptron with optional residual connections.

**attributes**: The attributes of this Class.
· in_dim: The dimensionality of the input features.  
· out_dim: The dimensionality of the output features.  
· hidden_dim: The dimensionality of the hidden layer.  
· use_residual: A boolean flag indicating whether to use residual connections.  
· operations: A module containing operations such as LayerNorm and Linear.

**Code Description**: The MLP class is a neural network module that inherits from nn.Module, designed to facilitate the construction of a multi-layer perceptron. It consists of an input layer, a hidden layer, and an output layer, with the option to include residual connections. The constructor initializes the layers and the activation function, which is set to GELU (Gaussian Error Linear Unit). 

The forward method defines the forward pass of the network. It first applies layer normalization to the input, followed by a linear transformation to the hidden layer, and then applies the activation function. The output is then passed through another linear transformation to produce the final output. If the use_residual flag is set to True, the original input is added to the output of the final layer, allowing for residual learning which can help in training deeper networks.

This class is utilized in the FuseModule class, where two instances of MLP are created. The first instance (mlp1) is configured without residual connections, while the second instance (mlp2) is configured to use residual connections. This design allows for flexible architecture in neural network models, enabling the combination of different configurations of MLPs to suit specific tasks.

**Note**: When using the MLP class, ensure that the in_dim and out_dim are equal if residual connections are enabled, as this is a requirement for the residual addition to function correctly.

**Output Example**: Given an input tensor of shape (batch_size, in_dim), the output of the MLP class will be a tensor of shape (batch_size, out_dim), which represents the transformed features after passing through the network.
### FunctionDef __init__(self, in_dim, out_dim, hidden_dim, use_residual, operations)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize an instance of the MLP class, setting up the necessary layers and parameters for the model.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· in_dim: An integer representing the input dimension of the model. This is the size of the input features that the model will process.
· out_dim: An integer representing the output dimension of the model. This defines the size of the output features produced by the model.
· hidden_dim: An integer representing the hidden dimension of the model. This specifies the size of the intermediate layer that connects the input and output layers.
· use_residual: A boolean flag indicating whether to use residual connections in the model. If set to True, it asserts that the input and output dimensions must be equal.
· operations: A module that contains the operations used to create layers, defaulting to ldm_patched.modules.ops, which includes custom implementations of Linear and LayerNorm.

**Code Description**: The __init__ method is a constructor for the MLP class, which is designed to create a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) architecture. It begins by calling the constructor of its parent class using `super().__init__()`, ensuring that any initialization defined in the parent class is also executed.

The method checks the `use_residual` parameter; if it is set to True, it asserts that the input dimension (`in_dim`) must be equal to the output dimension (`out_dim`). This is crucial for the implementation of residual connections, which require matching dimensions to allow for the addition of input and output tensors.

Next, the method initializes a LayerNorm layer using the input dimension. This layer normalizes the input features, which can enhance the stability and performance of the model during training. Following this, two Linear layers are created: the first transforms the input from `in_dim` to `hidden_dim`, and the second transforms from `hidden_dim` to `out_dim`. These layers are instantiated using the operations provided, which are sourced from the ldm_patched.modules.ops module. This module includes custom implementations of the Linear and LayerNorm classes, which are designed to disable weight initialization and allow for custom forward behavior.

The `use_residual` flag is stored as an instance attribute, allowing the model to reference it during the forward pass. Additionally, the activation function used in the model is set to GELU (Gaussian Error Linear Unit), which is a popular choice for neural networks due to its smooth non-linearity.

Overall, this __init__ method establishes the foundational components of the MLP class, ensuring that the model is properly configured for subsequent operations, such as forward propagation.

**Note**: Users should be aware of the implications of the `use_residual` parameter, as it directly affects the architecture of the model. Proper configuration of the input and output dimensions is essential when enabling residual connections to avoid dimension mismatch errors. Additionally, the choice of operations from the ldm_patched.modules.ops module should be considered, as they influence the behavior of the model during training and inference.

### FunctionDef forward(self, x)
**forward**: The function of forward is to perform a forward pass through a neural network layer, applying normalization, linear transformations, and an activation function, with optional residual connections.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· x: A tensor representing the input data to the layer, typically of shape (batch_size, features).

**Code Description**: The forward function processes the input tensor `x` through a series of transformations. Initially, it stores the original input in a variable called `residual`, which is used later for the residual connection if enabled. The input `x` is then passed through a layer normalization operation, which helps stabilize and accelerate the training of deep networks by normalizing the input across the features. 

Following normalization, the function applies the first fully connected layer (`fc1`) to the normalized input. The output of this layer is then passed through an activation function (`act_fn`), which introduces non-linearity into the model, allowing it to learn complex patterns. The result is then fed into a second fully connected layer (`fc2`).

If the `use_residual` attribute is set to true, the function adds the original input (`residual`) back to the output of the second fully connected layer. This residual connection helps in mitigating the vanishing gradient problem, allowing gradients to flow more easily through the network during backpropagation.

Finally, the function returns the processed tensor `x`, which can be used as input for subsequent layers in the network.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the input tensor `x` has the correct shape and type expected by the layer normalization and fully connected layers. The `use_residual` flag should be set according to the desired architecture of the neural network.

**Output Example**: A possible appearance of the code's return value could be a tensor of shape (batch_size, output_features), where `output_features` corresponds to the number of output units defined in the last fully connected layer. For instance, if the input tensor had a shape of (32, 128) and the output layer had 64 units, the return value would be a tensor of shape (32, 64).

· operations: A set of operations that includes layer normalization and other necessary functions.
· mlp1: The first multi-layer perceptron that processes concatenated embeddings.
· mlp2: The second multi-layer perceptron that further processes the output of the first MLP.
· layer_norm: A layer normalization operation applied to the final output embeddings.

**Code Description**: The FuseModule class is a neural network module that inherits from nn.Module, designed to combine and enhance embeddings from two sources: prompt embeddings and ID embeddings. It initializes with two multi-layer perceptrons (mlp1 and mlp2) and a layer normalization operation. The first MLP (mlp1) takes concatenated embeddings (prompt and ID) and processes them, while the second MLP (mlp2) refines the output of the first. The layer normalization is applied to the final output to stabilize the learning process.

The fuse_fn method is responsible for the core functionality of the class, where it concatenates the prompt and ID embeddings, processes them through the two MLPs, and applies layer normalization. This method ensures that the embeddings are effectively combined and transformed before being returned.

The forward method is the entry point for input data, where it accepts prompt embeddings, ID embeddings, and a mask for class tokens. It reshapes and prepares the embeddings for processing, ensuring that only valid ID embeddings are used based on the provided mask. The method then calls fuse_fn to combine the image token embeddings with the valid ID embeddings. Finally, it updates the prompt embeddings with the fused embeddings and returns the updated embeddings.

This class is utilized within the PhotoMakerIDEncoder, where an instance of FuseModule is created with specific parameters. The PhotoMakerIDEncoder uses this module to enhance the visual representation of inputs by leveraging the fusion of prompt and ID embeddings, thus improving the overall performance of the model in tasks related to image processing and encoding.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the input embeddings are of compatible types and shapes, as mismatches can lead to runtime errors. The class is designed to handle specific embedding dimensions, and any changes to these dimensions should be reflected in the instantiation of the FuseModule.

**Output Example**: A possible appearance of the code's return value could be a tensor of shape [batch_size, seq_length, embed_dim], containing the updated prompt embeddings after the fusion process, effectively integrating information from both prompt and ID embeddings.
### FunctionDef __init__(self, embed_dim, operations)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize an instance of the FuseModule class, setting up the necessary components for the neural network architecture.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· embed_dim: An integer representing the dimensionality of the embedding space used in the neural network.  
· operations: A module that contains various operations, including LayerNorm, which will be utilized in the construction of the neural network layers.

**Code Description**: The __init__ method of the FuseModule class is responsible for initializing the components that make up the module. It begins by calling the constructor of its parent class using super().__init__(), ensuring that any initialization defined in the parent class is executed.

Within this method, two instances of the MLP class are created. The first instance, mlp1, is initialized with parameters that specify the input dimension as embed_dim * 2, the output dimension as embed_dim, and the hidden dimension also as embed_dim. The use_residual flag is set to False, indicating that this particular MLP will not utilize residual connections. This design choice allows for a straightforward transformation of the input features without the complexity of residual learning.

The second instance, mlp2, is initialized with embed_dim for both the input and output dimensions, and it is configured to use residual connections by setting the use_residual flag to True. This configuration enables the MLP to incorporate residual learning, which can enhance the training of deeper networks by allowing gradients to flow more effectively through the layers.

Additionally, the method initializes a LayerNorm instance from the operations module, which is set to normalize the embeddings with a dimensionality of embed_dim. Layer normalization is a crucial step in neural network architectures as it helps stabilize and accelerate training by normalizing the inputs to each layer.

The FuseModule class, therefore, serves as a composite module that combines multiple MLPs with different configurations and includes normalization, facilitating the construction of flexible and powerful neural network architectures.

**Note**: When using the FuseModule class, it is essential to ensure that the embed_dim parameter is set appropriately, as it directly influences the dimensions of the MLPs and the LayerNorm component. Proper configuration of the operations parameter is also crucial, as it determines the behavior of the LayerNorm used within the module.

### FunctionDef fuse_fn(self, prompt_embeds, id_embeds)
**fuse_fn**: The function of fuse_fn is to combine and process prompt embeddings and ID embeddings through a series of transformations.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· prompt_embeds: A tensor containing the embeddings for the prompts, which are used as input for the fusion process.
· id_embeds: A tensor containing the ID embeddings that need to be fused with the prompt embeddings.

**Code Description**: The fuse_fn method is designed to take two sets of embeddings: prompt_embeds and id_embeds. It begins by concatenating these two tensors along the last dimension, resulting in a new tensor called stacked_id_embeds. This concatenation allows the model to leverage both the prompt and ID information simultaneously.

Following the concatenation, the function applies a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) transformation using self.mlp1, which processes the stacked embeddings. The output of this transformation is then added back to the original prompt_embeds, effectively incorporating the prompt information into the fused representation.

Next, the function applies another MLP transformation using self.mlp2 to further refine the stacked_id_embeds. After this, layer normalization is performed on the resulting tensor to stabilize the outputs and improve training dynamics.

The final output of the function is the normalized stacked_id_embeds, which represents the fused embeddings ready for subsequent processing.

This function is called within the forward method of the FuseModule class. In the forward method, the prompt embeddings are first processed to extract relevant image token embeddings based on a class tokens mask. The valid ID embeddings are also prepared by flattening and masking based on the number of inputs. The fuse_fn is then invoked with the image token embeddings and the valid ID embeddings, allowing for the integration of these two sources of information. The output from fuse_fn is subsequently used to update the prompt embeddings, ensuring that the final output reflects the combined information from both the prompt and ID embeddings.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the shapes of prompt_embeds and id_embeds are compatible for concatenation. Additionally, the layer normalization step is crucial for maintaining stable training and performance.

**Output Example**: A possible appearance of the code's return value could be a tensor of shape [b, seq_length, embedding_dim], where b is the batch size, seq_length is the number of tokens in the prompt, and embedding_dim is the dimensionality of the embeddings, typically 2048 in this context.

· id_embeds: A tensor containing the ID embeddings that need to be fused with the prompt embeddings. The shape of this tensor is [b, max_num_inputs, 1, 2048].
· class_tokens_mask: A tensor that acts as a mask to identify which tokens in the prompt embeddings correspond to image tokens. Its shape is [b, seq_length].

**Code Description**: The forward method begins by ensuring that the id_embeds tensor is converted to the same data type as the prompt_embeds tensor. It calculates the number of valid inputs by summing the class_tokens_mask and reshaping it accordingly. The batch size and maximum number of inputs are extracted from the id_embeds tensor shape. The sequence length is determined from the prompt_embeds tensor.

Next, the id_embeds tensor is flattened to create flat_id_embeds, which reshapes it into a two-dimensional tensor suitable for processing. A valid_id_mask is generated to filter out the valid ID embeddings based on the number of inputs. The valid ID embeddings are then extracted using this mask.

The prompt_embeds and class_tokens_mask tensors are also reshaped to ensure they are in the correct format for subsequent operations. The image token embeddings are sliced from the prompt_embeds using the class_tokens_mask.

The core of the method involves calling the fuse_fn function, which combines the image token embeddings with the valid ID embeddings. This function is responsible for concatenating the two sets of embeddings and applying transformations to produce a fused representation. The output from fuse_fn, referred to as stacked_id_embeds, is then used to update the prompt_embeds tensor at the positions indicated by the class_tokens_mask.

Finally, the updated prompt embeddings are reshaped back to their original dimensions, resulting in a tensor that reflects the integration of both prompt and ID information. The method returns this updated tensor.

This function is integral to the FuseModule class, facilitating the combination of different types of embeddings to enhance the model's understanding and processing of input data.

**Note**: It is crucial to ensure that the shapes of prompt_embeds and id_embeds are compatible for the operations performed within this method. The masking and reshaping steps are essential for correctly aligning the embeddings before fusion.

**Output Example**: A possible appearance of the code's return value could be a tensor of shape [b, seq_length, embedding_dim], where b is the batch size, seq_length is the number of tokens in the prompt, and embedding_dim is the dimensionality of the embeddings, typically 2048 in this context.

**Code Description**: The PhotoMakerIDEncoder class extends the CLIPVisionModelProjection class, which is responsible for projecting visual features extracted from images into a specified dimensional space. Upon initialization, the PhotoMakerIDEncoder sets up the necessary devices and data types for processing. It initializes a second linear projection layer (visual_projection_2) and a fuse module to combine embeddings.

The forward method of the PhotoMakerIDEncoder class takes in three parameters: id_pixel_values, prompt_embeds, and class_tokens_mask. It reshapes the id_pixel_values tensor to prepare it for processing and extracts shared embeddings from the vision model. These embeddings are then projected into two different dimensions using the visual_projection and visual_projection_2 layers. The resulting embeddings are concatenated and passed to the fuse module along with the prompt embeddings and class tokens mask. The output is an updated version of the prompt embeddings that incorporates the visual information.

This class is utilized within the load_photomaker_model function of the PhotoMakerLoader class.

### FunctionDef __init__(self)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize the PhotoMakerIDEncoder class and set up its components.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· There are no parameters for this function.

**Code Description**: The __init__ method is the constructor for the PhotoMakerIDEncoder class, responsible for initializing the instance and setting up necessary components for its operation. 

Upon instantiation, the method first calls the `ldm_patched.modules.model_management.text_encoder_device()` function to determine the appropriate device (CPU or GPU) for the text encoder, which is stored in the `self.load_device` attribute. This ensures that the encoder can utilize the best available hardware for processing.

Next, the method retrieves the offload device by calling `ldm_patched.modules.model_management.text_encoder_offload_device()`, which decides whether to use the GPU or CPU based on configuration settings. This value is stored in the `offload_device` variable.

The data type for the text encoder is then determined by invoking `ldm_patched.modules.model_management.text_encoder_dtype(self.load_device)`, which assesses the current device and global configuration flags to return the appropriate data type (e.g., float16, float32).

The constructor then calls the superclass's `__init__` method with several parameters: `VISION_CONFIG_DICT`, `dtype`, `offload_device`, and `ldm_patched.modules.ops.manual_cast`. This establishes the foundational configuration for the PhotoMakerIDEncoder, allowing it to inherit properties and methods from its parent class.

Following this, the method initializes a linear transformation layer using `ldm_patched.modules.ops.manual_cast.Linear(1024, 1280, bias=False)`, which is assigned to the `self.visual_projection_2` attribute. This layer is designed to transform the input embeddings from a dimensionality of 1024 to 1280 without a bias term.

Additionally, an instance of the FuseModule class is created with parameters 2048 and `ldm_patched.modules.ops.manual_cast`. This instance is stored in the `self.fuse_module` attribute, allowing the PhotoMakerIDEncoder to fuse and process embeddings from prompts and IDs effectively.

· prompt_embeds: A tensor representing the embeddings of the prompts that will be updated based on the input pixel values.
· class_tokens_mask: A tensor used to mask class tokens during the fusion process.

**Code Description**: The forward function begins by unpacking the shape of the input tensor `id_pixel_values`, which consists of batch size (b), number of inputs (num_inputs), number of channels (c), height (h), and width (w). It then reshapes `id_pixel_values` to combine the batch size and number of inputs into a single dimension, resulting in a tensor of shape (b * num_inputs, c, h, w).

Next, the function passes the reshaped `id_pixel_values` through a vision model, which outputs a set of shared embeddings. The second output of the vision model (index [2]) is captured in `shared_id_embeds`. These embeddings are then projected into a different space using two separate visual projection layers, resulting in `id_embeds` and `id_embeds_2`.

Both `id_embeds` and `id_embeds_2` are reshaped to have dimensions (b, num_inputs, 1, -1), where -1 allows for automatic calculation of the last dimension size based on the total number of elements. The two sets of embeddings are concatenated along the last dimension, creating a combined embedding tensor.

Finally, the function calls a fusion module, `fuse_module`, which takes the original `prompt_embeds`, the concatenated `id_embeds`, and the `class_tokens_mask` as inputs. This module updates the prompt embeddings based on the provided pixel values and returns the updated embeddings.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the input tensors are correctly shaped and that the vision model and projection layers are properly initialized before calling this function. The function assumes that the `fuse_module` is capable of handling the provided inputs appropriately.

**Output Example**: A possible appearance of the code's return value could be a tensor of shape (b, num_inputs, updated_embedding_dimension), where `updated_embedding_dimension` is determined by the fusion process and the dimensions of the input embeddings.
***
## ClassDef PhotoMakerLoader
**PhotoMakerLoader**: The function of PhotoMakerLoader is to load a photomaker model based on the provided model name.

This input is a dictionary that mandates the presence of a "photomaker_model_name", which is derived from a list of filenames obtained through the utility function `ldm_patched.utils.path_utils.get_filename_list("photomaker")`. 

The class defines a RETURN_TYPES attribute that indicates the output type, which is a tuple containing the string "PHOTOMAKER". The FUNCTION attribute specifies the name of the method responsible for loading the model, which is "load_photomaker_model". The CATEGORY attribute categorizes this class under "_for_testing/photomaker", indicating its intended use case.

The core functionality is encapsulated in the `load_photomaker_model` method. This method takes a single parameter, `photomaker_model_name`, which is used to construct the full path to the model file using `ldm_patched.utils.path_utils.get_full_path("photomaker", photomaker_model_name)`. It then initializes an instance of `PhotoMakerIDEncoder` to represent the photomaker model. The model's state is loaded from a Torch file located at the constructed path using `ldm_patched.modules.utils.load_torch_file`, with the `safe_load` parameter set to True for safety during loading.

If the loaded data contains an "id_encoder" key, the method extracts the corresponding value, which is expected to be the state dictionary for the photomaker model. The state dictionary is then loaded into the `photomaker_model` instance using the `load_state_dict` method. Finally, the method returns a tuple containing the loaded photomaker model.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the photomaker model name provided exists in the specified directory, and that the Torch file is correctly formatted to include the necessary state data for the model to load successfully.

This inner dictionary has a key "photomaker_model_name," which is associated with a tuple containing the result of the function call to `ldm_patched.utils.path_utils.get_filename_list("photomaker")`. 

The `get_filename_list` function is responsible for retrieving a list of filenames from the "photomaker" folder. It utilizes a caching mechanism to improve efficiency by storing previously retrieved filenames, thus avoiding repeated filesystem access. This function is crucial for the INPUT_TYPES function as it dynamically provides the available filenames that can be used as input for the PhotoMakerLoader.

The relationship between INPUT_TYPES and its callees is significant; INPUT_TYPES relies on `get_filename_list` to ensure that it returns the most current and relevant filenames from the specified folder. This integration allows the PhotoMakerLoader to operate effectively with the latest data, enhancing its functionality and user experience.

**Note**: When using this function, it is important to ensure that the "photomaker" folder exists and is correctly configured within the project structure. The successful execution of INPUT_TYPES depends on the proper functioning of the `get_filename_list` function, which in turn relies on the configuration of the global variable folder_names_and_paths.

**Output Example**: An example of the return value from INPUT_TYPES could be:
```
{
    "required": {
        "photomaker_model_name": (['model1.pth', 'model2.pth', 'model3.pth'],)
    }
}

### FunctionDef load_photomaker_model(self, photomaker_model_name)
**load_photomaker_model**: The function of load_photomaker_model is to load a pre-trained photomaker model based on the specified model name.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· photomaker_model_name: A string representing the name of the photomaker model to be loaded.

**Code Description**: The load_photomaker_model function is responsible for loading a photomaker model by first determining the full path to the model file using the get_full_path function from the ldm_patched.utils.path_utils module. It constructs this path by passing the folder name "photomaker" and the provided photomaker_model_name to get_full_path. 

Once the full path is retrieved, an instance of the PhotoMakerIDEncoder class is created. This class is designed to encode image pixel values into a format suitable for further processing, integrating visual embeddings with prompt embeddings. The function then calls load_torch_file from the ldm_patched.modules.utils module to load the model's state from the specified path. The load_torch_file function handles the loading of PyTorch model checkpoints, ensuring that the model is loaded correctly based on the file format and specified loading options.

After loading the model's state, the function checks if the loaded data contains an "id_encoder" key. If this key is present, it extracts the corresponding data. The state dictionary is then loaded into the photomaker_model instance using the load_state_dict method. Finally, the function returns a tuple containing the initialized photomaker_model.

This function is critical in the workflow of the project as it establishes the connection between the model's file path, the loading mechanism, and the instantiation of the model itself, ensuring that the photomaker model is ready for use in subsequent processing tasks.

**Note**: It is essential to ensure that the photomaker_model_name provided corresponds to an existing model file in the expected directory. If the model path is incorrect or the file does not exist, the function may fail to load the model properly.

**Output Example**: A possible return value from load_photomaker_model could be a tuple containing an instance of PhotoMakerIDEncoder, such as (PhotoMakerIDEncoder instance,).

## ClassDef PhotoMakerEncode
**PhotoMakerEncode**: The function of PhotoMakerEncode is to process images and text inputs to generate conditioning outputs for a photomaker model.

**attributes**: The attributes of this Class.
· INPUT_TYPES: Specifies the required input types for the class method, including photomaker, image, clip, and text.
· RETURN_TYPES: Indicates the type of output returned by the class method, which is "CONDITIONING".
· FUNCTION: The name of the function that will be executed, which is "apply_photomaker".
· CATEGORY: Defines the category under which this class is categorized, specifically for testing purposes related to photomaker.

**Code Description**: The PhotoMakerEncode class is designed to facilitate the encoding of images and text for a photomaker application. It contains a class method INPUT_TYPES that defines the required inputs: a photomaker instance, an image, a clip, and a text string. The text string has a default value and supports multiline input. The class also specifies that it returns a conditioning output.

The core functionality is implemented in the apply_photomaker method, which takes four parameters: photomaker, image, clip, and text. The method begins by preprocessing the input image using a clip vision module, converting it into pixel values suitable for the photomaker's device. It then attempts to locate a special token ("photomaker") within the provided text to determine its position. If the token is found, it is used to adjust the tokenization process.

The text is tokenized using the clip module, and the tokens are processed to create an output dictionary that maps the original tokens to their modified versions. This is done to ensure that the special token's index is appropriately handled during encoding. The method then encodes the tokens using the clip module, returning both the conditioning output and a pooled representation.

If the special token is found in the text, the method constructs a class tokens mask to guide the photomaker in generating the output. The final output is either the conditioning output or the conditioning output modified by the photomaker, depending on the presence of the special token.

The method concludes by returning a tuple containing the output and additional information about the pooled output.

**Note**: It is essential to ensure that the input types match the expected formats, as defined in the INPUT_TYPES method. The special token must be included in the text for specific functionality to be activated.

**Output Example**: A possible appearance of the code's return value could be:
[
    [
        output_tensor, 
        {"pooled_output": pooled_tensor}
    ]
]
Where output_tensor represents the generated conditioning output and pooled_tensor contains the pooled representation of the encoded tokens.

**Code Description**: The INPUT_TYPES function constructs a dictionary that specifies the required input types for a photomaker application. The returned dictionary contains a single key, "required", which maps to another dictionary detailing the specific input types needed. Each input type is represented as a tuple, where the first element is a string indicating the type, and the second element (if present) provides additional configuration options.

The input types defined in the function are as follows:
- "photomaker": This input type is designated as "PHOTOMAKER", indicating that the user must provide a photomaker object.
- "image": This input type is designated as "IMAGE", which signifies that an image input is required.
- "clip": This input type is designated as "CLIP", indicating that a clip input is also required.
- "text": This input type is designated as "STRING". This input type has additional options specified in a dictionary, allowing for multiline input and setting a default value of "photograph of photomaker".

The structure of the returned dictionary is crucial for ensuring that the necessary inputs are provided when the function is invoked, thereby facilitating the correct operation of the photomaker functionality.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that all required input types are provided when utilizing the functionality that relies on this INPUT_TYPES definition. Failure to provide the necessary inputs may result in errors or unexpected behavior.

**Output Example**: A possible appearance of the code's return value could be:
{
    "required": {
        "photomaker": ("PHOTOMAKER",),
        "image": ("IMAGE",),
        "clip": ("CLIP",),
        "text": ("STRING", {"multiline": True, "default": "photograph of photomaker"})
    }
}

### FunctionDef apply_photomaker(self, photomaker, image, clip, text)
**apply_photomaker**: The function of apply_photomaker is to apply a photomaker model to an image based on a specified text prompt, processing the image and text to generate an output.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· photomaker: An instance of the photomaker model that will be used to process the image.
· image: A tensor representing the image to be processed, expected to be in a format compatible with the photomaker model.
· clip: An instance of the CLIP model used for tokenizing and encoding the text prompt.
· text: A string containing the text prompt that guides the photomaker in generating the output.

**Code Description**: The apply_photomaker function begins by defining a special token, "photomaker", which is used to identify the position of the photomaker-related information within the text prompt. It preprocesses the input image using the clip_preprocess function, which prepares the image tensor for input into the CLIP model by resizing, normalizing, and adjusting the image dimensions.

The function then attempts to locate the index of the special token within the provided text. If the token is found, its index is recorded; if not, the index is set to -1. The text is tokenized using the clip instance, and the resulting tokens are organized into a dictionary, out_tokens, where each key corresponds to a tokenized input and each value is a list of filtered tokens, ensuring that the special token's index is excluded from the filtering process.

Next, the function encodes the tokens using the clip model, producing a conditional embedding (cond) and a pooled output (pooled). If the special token was found in the text (index > 0), the function prepares a mask for class tokens based on the token index and invokes the photomaker model with the preprocessed pixel values and the conditional embeddings. The output from the photomaker is then returned along with the pooled output.

If the special token is not present in the text, the function simply returns the conditional embeddings without invoking the photomaker model.

This function is integral to the interaction between the image and text components of the project, allowing for dynamic image processing based on user-defined prompts. It leverages the capabilities of both the photomaker and CLIP models to generate meaningful outputs that reflect the input image and text.

**Note**: It is essential to ensure that the input image tensor is correctly formatted and that the text prompt includes the special token "photomaker" when intending to utilize the photomaker model. Failure to do so may result in the function returning only the conditional embeddings without any photomaker processing.

**Output Example**: A possible return value of the function would be a list containing the output from the photomaker model along with a dictionary that includes the pooled output, structured as follows: [[[output_tensor, {"pooled_output": pooled_tensor}]]].
