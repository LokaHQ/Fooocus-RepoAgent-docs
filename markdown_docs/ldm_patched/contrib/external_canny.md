## FunctionDef get_canny_nms_kernel(device, dtype)
**get_canny_nms_kernel**: The function of get_canny_nms_kernel is to return 3x3 kernels used for the Canny Non-maximal suppression process.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· device: Specifies the device on which the tensor will be allocated (e.g., CPU or GPU).
· dtype: Specifies the data type of the returned tensor (e.g., float32, float64).

**Code Description**: The get_canny_nms_kernel function is a utility that generates a set of 3x3 convolutional kernels specifically designed for the non-maximal suppression step in the Canny edge detection algorithm. This step is crucial as it helps in thinning the edges by suppressing non-maximum pixels in the gradient magnitude image. The function constructs a tensor containing eight distinct kernels, each representing a different orientation for edge detection. The kernels are defined in a way that emphasizes the central pixel while comparing it with its neighbors, effectively allowing the algorithm to determine whether the central pixel is a local maximum in the gradient direction.

The function is invoked within the canny function, which implements the Canny edge detection algorithm. In the canny function, after computing the gradient magnitudes and angles from the input image, the get_canny_nms_kernel function is called to retrieve the necessary kernels for performing non-maximal suppression. The resulting kernels are then used in a convolution operation to filter the gradient magnitudes, ensuring that only the strongest edges are retained for further processing. This relationship highlights the importance of get_canny_nms_kernel in the overall edge detection workflow, as it directly influences the quality and accuracy of the edge detection results.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the device and dtype parameters are set appropriately to match the input tensor's specifications to avoid any runtime errors.

**get_hysteresis_kernel**: The function of get_hysteresis_kernel is to return the 3x3 kernels used for the Canny hysteresis process.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· device: Specifies the device on which the tensor will be allocated (e.g., CPU or GPU).
· dtype: Specifies the data type of the returned tensor (e.g., float32, float64).

**Code Description**: The get_hysteresis_kernel function is a utility that generates a set of 3x3 kernels specifically designed for the hysteresis step in the Canny edge detection algorithm. The function constructs a tensor containing eight distinct kernels, each represented as a 3D tensor with a single channel. These kernels are used to identify strong and weak edges in the image during the hysteresis thresholding phase of the Canny algorithm. 

The function accepts two optional parameters: `device` and `dtype`. The `device` parameter allows the user to specify the hardware on which the tensor will be created, ensuring compatibility with the computational environment (such as using a GPU for faster processing). The `dtype` parameter allows the user to define the data type of the tensor, which can be important for memory management and performance optimization.

The get_hysteresis_kernel function is called within the canny function, which implements the Canny edge detection algorithm. Specifically, it is invoked when hysteresis edge tracking is enabled. The canny function processes an input image tensor, applies Gaussian blurring, computes gradients, and performs non-maximum suppression. During the hysteresis phase, the edges are refined using the kernels obtained from get_hysteresis_kernel. This relationship highlights the importance of get_hysteresis_kernel in providing the necessary kernels that facilitate the edge tracking process in the overall Canny edge detection workflow.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the device and dtype parameters are compatible with the input tensor used in the canny function to avoid runtime errors.

**Output Example**: A possible appearance of the code's return value could be a tensor structured as follows:
```
tensor([[[[0.0, 0.0, 0.0],
          [0.0, 0.0, 1.0],
          [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]]],
        [[[0.0, 0.0, 0.0],
          [0.0, 0.0, 0.0],
          [0.0, 0.0, 1.0]]],
        [[[0.0, 0.0, 0.0],
          [0.0, 0.0, 0.0],
          [0.0, 1.0, 0.0]]],
        [[[0.0, 0.0, 0.0],
          [0.0, 0.0, 0.0],
          [1.0, 0.0, 0.0]]],
        [[[0.0, 0.0, 0.0],

## FunctionDef gaussian_blur_2d(img, kernel_size, sigma)
**gaussian_blur_2d**: The function of gaussian_blur_2d is to apply a 2D Gaussian blur to an input image tensor.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· img: A tensor representing the input image with shape (B, C, H, W), where B is the batch size, C is the number of channels, H is the height, and W is the width of the image.
· kernel_size: An integer representing the size of the Gaussian kernel. It must be an odd number to ensure a symmetric kernel.
· sigma: A float representing the standard deviation of the Gaussian distribution, which controls the amount of blur applied to the image.

**Code Description**: The gaussian_blur_2d function performs a Gaussian blur on the input image tensor. It begins by calculating half the kernel size to define the range for generating the Gaussian kernel. The function then creates a 1D Gaussian probability density function (PDF) using the specified sigma value. This PDF is normalized to create a 1D Gaussian kernel, which is subsequently expanded into a 2D kernel through matrix multiplication. The resulting 2D kernel is then adjusted to match the number of channels in the input image.

Before applying the convolution, the input image is padded using a reflective padding method to prevent boundary effects during the convolution operation. The convolution is performed using the 2D Gaussian kernel, effectively blurring the image. The output is a blurred image tensor of the same shape as the input.

This function is called within the canny function, which implements the Canny edge detection algorithm. The gaussian_blur_2d function is crucial in the preprocessing step of the Canny algorithm, where it smooths the input image to reduce noise and improve edge detection accuracy. By applying Gaussian blur, the canny function enhances the detection of significant edges while suppressing minor variations in pixel intensity.

**Note**: Ensure that the kernel_size parameter is an odd integer to maintain symmetry in the Gaussian kernel. The sigma parameter should be chosen based on the desired level of blurriness; larger values will result in a more pronounced blur effect.

**Output Example**: Given an input image tensor of shape (1, 3, 256, 256) and a kernel_size of 5 with sigma of 1, the output will be a blurred image tensor of the same shape (1, 3, 256, 256), where the pixel values have been smoothed according to the Gaussian distribution.
## FunctionDef get_sobel_kernel2d(device, dtype)
**get_sobel_kernel2d**: The function of get_sobel_kernel2d is to generate Sobel kernels for computing image gradients in both the x and y directions.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· device: An optional parameter that specifies the device on which the tensor will be allocated (e.g., CPU or GPU).
· dtype: An optional parameter that specifies the data type of the tensor (e.g., float32 or float64).

**Code Description**: The get_sobel_kernel2d function creates two Sobel kernels, kernel_x and kernel_y, which are used for edge detection in images. The kernel_x is defined as a 3x3 tensor that represents the Sobel operator for detecting horizontal edges, while kernel_y is simply the transpose of kernel_x, representing the Sobel operator for detecting vertical edges. The function then stacks these two kernels along a new dimension, resulting in a tensor of shape (2, 3, 3), where the first slice corresponds to kernel_x and the second slice corresponds to kernel_y. 

This function is called within the spatial_gradient function, which computes the first-order image derivative using the Sobel operator. In spatial_gradient, the get_sobel_kernel2d function is invoked to allocate the Sobel kernels based on the input image's device and data type. The kernels are then optionally normalized before being used in a convolution operation to compute the gradients of the input image. The output of spatial_gradient is a tensor containing the gradients in both the x and y directions, structured as (B, C, 2, H, W), where B is the batch size, C is the number of channels, and H and W are the height and width of the input image.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the input tensor to the spatial_gradient function is properly shaped and that the device and dtype parameters are compatible with the intended computation.

**Output Example**: A possible return value of get_sobel_kernel2d could be:
tensor([[[-1.0, 0.0, 1.0],
         [-2.0, 0.0, 2.0],
         [-1.0, 0.0, 1.0]],

        [[-1.0, -2.0, -1.0],
         [0.0, 0.0, 0.0],
         [1.0, 2.0, 1.0]]])
## FunctionDef spatial_gradient(input, normalized)
**spatial_gradient**: The function of spatial_gradient is to compute the first order image derivative in both x and y directions using a Sobel operator.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· input: A tensor representing the input image with shape :math:`(B, C, H, W)`, where B is the batch size, C is the number of channels, H is the height, and W is the width of the image.
· normalized: A boolean flag indicating whether the output should be normalized. The default value is True.

**Code Description**: The spatial_gradient function calculates the gradients of an input image tensor by applying the Sobel operator, which is a widely used method for edge detection in image processing. The function begins by generating the Sobel kernels for both x and y directions using the get_sobel_kernel2d function, which allocates the kernels based on the input image's device and data type. If the normalized parameter is set to True, the kernels are normalized before use.

The input tensor is reshaped and padded to accommodate the convolution operation, ensuring that the spatial dimensions are preserved while the channel dimension is handled appropriately. The convolution is performed using the prepared Sobel kernels, resulting in a tensor that contains the gradients in both x and y directions. The output tensor has the shape :math:`(B, C, 2, H, W)`, where the last dimension corresponds to the two gradient channels.

The spatial_gradient function is called within the canny function, which implements the Canny edge detection algorithm. In canny, the spatial_gradient function is used to compute the gradients of a blurred version of the input image, which are then utilized to calculate the gradient magnitude and angle. This information is essential for the subsequent steps in the Canny algorithm, including non-maximum suppression and hysteresis thresholding.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the input tensor to the spatial_gradient function is properly shaped and that the device and dtype parameters are compatible with the intended computation. The function assumes that the input image is in the correct format and does not perform additional checks for tensor validity.

**Output Example**: A possible return value of spatial_gradient could be:
tensor([[[[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0],
          [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0],
          [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0],
          [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]],

         [[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0],
          [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0],
          [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0],
          [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]]]])
## FunctionDef rgb_to_grayscale(image, rgb_weights)
**rgb_to_grayscale**: The function of rgb_to_grayscale is to convert an RGB image into its grayscale version.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· image: An RGB image tensor to be converted to grayscale, expected to have the shape :math:`(*,3,H,W)`, where * represents any number of batches, 3 represents the RGB channels, and H and W are the height and width of the image, respectively.
· rgb_weights: Optional weights to be applied to each RGB channel. The sum of these weights should equal one. If not provided, default weights will be used based on the image data type.

**Code Description**: The rgb_to_grayscale function takes an RGB image tensor as input and converts it to a grayscale image. The function first checks if the input image has the correct shape, ensuring that it contains three channels corresponding to the RGB color model. If the shape is invalid, a ValueError is raised. 

If the rgb_weights parameter is not provided, the function determines the appropriate weights based on the data type of the input image. For 8-bit images, it uses weights of [76, 150, 29], and for floating-point images, it defaults to weights of [0.299, 0.587, 0.114]. If custom weights are provided, they are ensured to be compatible with the input image's device and data type.

The function then unpacks the RGB channels from the input image tensor and applies the specified weights to each channel. The final grayscale image is computed as a weighted sum of the red, green, and blue channels, resulting in a tensor with a shape of :math:`(*,1,H,W)`.

This function is called within the canny function, which implements the Canny edge detection algorithm. Before applying the Canny algorithm, the input image is converted to grayscale using rgb_to_grayscale if it has three channels. This conversion is crucial as the Canny algorithm operates on single-channel images, and the grayscale representation enhances edge detection performance.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the input image is in the expected format and range (0, 1) for accurate conversion. The function will raise errors if the input does not meet the specified criteria.

**Output Example**: Given an input tensor of shape (2, 3, 4, 5) representing two RGB images, the output of the rgb_to_grayscale function would be a tensor of shape (2, 1, 4, 5), containing the grayscale representation of the input images.
## FunctionDef canny(input, low_threshold, high_threshold, kernel_size, sigma, hysteresis, eps)
**canny**: The function of canny is to find edges of the input image and filters them using the Canny algorithm.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· input: input image tensor with shape :math:`(B,C,H,W)`.
· low_threshold: lower threshold for the hysteresis procedure.
· high_threshold: upper threshold for the hysteresis procedure.
· kernel_size: the size of the kernel for the Gaussian blur.
· sigma: the standard deviation of the kernel for the Gaussian blur.
· hysteresis: if True, applies the hysteresis edge tracking. Otherwise, the edges are divided between weak (0.5) and strong (1) edges.
· eps: regularization number to avoid NaN during backprop.

**Code Description**: The canny function implements the Canny edge detection algorithm, which is a multi-stage process used to detect a wide range of edges in images. The function begins by checking the input image tensor to ensure it is in the correct format. If the input image has three channels (RGB), it is converted to grayscale using the rgb_to_grayscale function. This conversion is essential because the Canny algorithm operates on single-channel images.

Next, the function applies a Gaussian blur to the grayscale image using the gaussian_blur_2d function. This step helps to reduce noise and detail in the image, which is crucial for effective edge detection. The Gaussian kernel size and standard deviation are specified by the kernel_size and sigma parameters, respectively.

After blurring, the function computes the spatial gradients of the image using the spatial_gradient function. This function calculates the first-order derivatives in both the x and y directions, providing the necessary information to determine the gradient magnitude and direction.

The gradient magnitude is calculated using the formula `magnitude = sqrt(gx^2 + gy^2 + eps)`, where gx and gy are the gradients in the x and y directions, respectively. The angle of the gradient is also computed, which is then quantized to the nearest 45 degrees for non-maximum suppression.

Non-maximum suppression is performed to thin out the edges. This is achieved by applying the non-maximal suppression kernels obtained from the get_canny_nms_kernel function. The resulting image retains only the local maxima in the gradient magnitude, which are potential edges.

Following non-maximum suppression, the function applies thresholding to classify the edges into strong and weak categories based on the specified low and high thresholds. If hysteresis is enabled, the function performs hysteresis edge tracking to connect weak edges to strong edges, ensuring that only significant edges are retained.

The canny function returns two outputs: the gradient magnitudes and the final edge map after applying the thresholds and hysteresis. This function is called by the detect_edge method within the Canny class, which prepares the input image by moving the channel dimension and ensuring it is on the correct device before invoking the canny function. The output from canny is then processed to create a three-channel output image for visualization.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the input image tensor is properly shaped and that the parameters low_threshold and high_threshold are set appropriately to avoid runtime errors. The function assumes that the input image is normalized and in the range of (0, 1).

**Output Example**: The output of the canny function would be two tensors: the first tensor representing the gradient magnitudes with shape :math:`(B,1,H,W)` and the second tensor representing the edge detection results with the same shape :math:`(B,1,H,W)`. For example, given an input tensor of shape (5, 3, 4, 4), the output could be:
```
magnitude.shape: torch.Size([5, 1, 4, 4])
edges.shape: torch.Size([5, 1, 4, 4])
```
## ClassDef Canny
**Canny**: The function of Canny is to perform edge detection on an image using the Canny edge detection algorithm.

**attributes**: The attributes of this Class.
· INPUT_TYPES: A class method that defines the required input types for the edge detection function.
· RETURN_TYPES: A tuple indicating the type of output returned by the edge detection function.
· FUNCTION: A string that specifies the name of the function used for edge detection.
· CATEGORY: A string that categorizes the functionality of the class.

**Code Description**: The Canny class is designed to implement the Canny edge detection algorithm on images. It includes a class method `INPUT_TYPES` that specifies the required inputs for the edge detection process. The inputs include an image and two floating-point thresholds: `low_threshold` and `high_threshold`. The thresholds are defined with default values and constraints on their range. The class also defines `RETURN_TYPES`, which indicates that the output will be an image, and `FUNCTION`, which specifies the function name used for processing. The `CATEGORY` attribute categorizes the class under "image/preprocessors".

The core functionality is encapsulated in the `detect_edge` method, which takes an image and the two thresholds as parameters. Inside this method, the input image is first converted to the appropriate device using `ldm_patched.modules.model_management.get_torch_device()`, and the channel dimension is rearranged. The Canny edge detection is then applied using the `canny` function, which processes the image based on the provided thresholds. The output is then formatted by repeating the single-channel output to create a three-channel image, making it suitable for standard image formats. Finally, the method returns the processed image as a tuple.

**Note**: When using the Canny class, ensure that the input image is in the correct format and that the thresholds are set within the specified range to achieve optimal edge detection results.

**Output Example**: A possible appearance of the code's return value could be a three-channel image where edges are highlighted, represented as a tensor with dimensions corresponding to the image height and width, with three channels for color representation.
### FunctionDef INPUT_TYPES(s)
**INPUT_TYPES**: The function of INPUT_TYPES is to define and return the required input types for a specific image processing function.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· parameter1: s - This parameter is a placeholder that can be used to pass additional context or state information, though it is not utilized within the function.

**Code Description**: The INPUT_TYPES function constructs and returns a dictionary that specifies the required input types for an image processing operation. The dictionary contains a single key, "required", which maps to another dictionary detailing the specific inputs needed. This inner dictionary includes three keys: "image", "low_threshold", and "high_threshold". 

- The "image" key is associated with a tuple containing the string "IMAGE", indicating that the input must be an image type.
- The "low_threshold" key is linked to a tuple that specifies it as a "FLOAT" type. Additionally, it includes a dictionary that defines default, minimum, maximum, and step values for this threshold. The default value is set to 0.4, with a minimum of 0.01, a maximum of 0.99, and a step increment of 0.01.
- The "high_threshold" key is similarly defined as a "FLOAT" type, with its own set of parameters: a default value of 0.8, a minimum of 0.01, a maximum of 0.99, and a step of 0.01.

This structured approach ensures that the function clearly communicates the expected types and constraints for each input, facilitating proper usage and validation in the context of image processing.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the inputs provided to the function conform to the specified types and constraints to avoid errors during execution. The thresholds should be within the defined range to maintain the integrity of the image processing operation.

**Output Example**: An example of the return value from the INPUT_TYPES function would be:
{
    "required": {
        "image": ("IMAGE",),
        "low_threshold": ("FLOAT", {"default": 0.4, "min": 0.01, "max": 0.99, "step": 0.01}),
        "high_threshold": ("FLOAT", {"default": 0.8, "min": 0.01, "max": 0.99, "step": 0.01})
    }
}

### FunctionDef detect_edge(self, image, low_threshold, high_threshold)
**detect_edge**: The function of detect_edge is to perform edge detection on an input image using the Canny edge detection algorithm.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· image: A tensor representing the input image, which is expected to be in the format suitable for processing (shape: (B, C, H, W)).
· low_threshold: A float value representing the lower threshold for the hysteresis procedure in edge detection.
· high_threshold: A float value representing the upper threshold for the hysteresis procedure in edge detection.

**Code Description**: The detect_edge function is designed to apply the Canny edge detection algorithm to an input image tensor. It first ensures that the input image is transferred to the appropriate device for processing, which is determined by the get_torch_device function. This function checks the system's hardware configuration to select the optimal device (CPU, GPU, or XPU) for executing the operations.

The image tensor is then manipulated to adjust its channel dimension from the last position to the second position using the movedim method. This adjustment is necessary because the canny function expects the input image tensor to have the channel dimension in a specific order.

Once the image is prepared, the function calls the canny function, passing the adjusted image tensor along with the specified low and high thresholds. The canny function implements a multi-stage process to detect edges in the image, which includes converting the image to grayscale, applying Gaussian blur, calculating gradients, performing non-maximum suppression, and applying hysteresis thresholding.

The output of the canny function consists of two tensors: the first tensor represents the gradient magnitudes, and the second tensor represents the final edge map after applying the thresholds and hysteresis. The detect_edge function then processes the output to create a three-channel image suitable for visualization by repeating the edge detection results across three channels and moving the channel dimension back to the last position.

Finally, the function returns a tuple containing the processed output image tensor, which can be utilized for further analysis or visualization in subsequent steps of the image processing pipeline.

**Note**: It is crucial to ensure that the input image tensor is correctly shaped and that the low_threshold and high_threshold parameters are set appropriately to avoid runtime errors. The function assumes that the input image is normalized and within the range of (0, 1).

**Output Example**: The output of the detect_edge function would be a tuple containing a tensor representing the edge-detected image. For example, given an input tensor of shape (5, 3, 4, 4), the output could be:
```
img_out.shape: torch.Size([5, 4, 4, 3])
```
