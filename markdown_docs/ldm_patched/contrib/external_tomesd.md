## FunctionDef do_nothing(x, mode)
**do_nothing**: The function of do_nothing is to return the input tensor unchanged.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· x: A torch.Tensor that is the input tensor to be returned.
· mode: An optional string parameter that is not utilized within the function.

**Code Description**: The do_nothing function is a simple utility function that takes a single input parameter, x, which is expected to be a PyTorch tensor. The function does not perform any operations on the input tensor and simply returns it as is. The second parameter, mode, is defined but not used in the function's logic, indicating that it may be a placeholder for future enhancements or for compatibility with other functions that may require a similar signature.

This function is called within the bipartite_soft_matching_random2d function, which is responsible for partitioning tokens into source and destination groups and merging a specified number of tokens from the source to the destination. In the context of bipartite_soft_matching_random2d, do_nothing serves as a fallback mechanism. If certain conditions are met (specifically, if the number of tokens to remove is less than or equal to zero, or if the width or height of the image is one), the function returns do_nothing for both merging and unmerging operations. This ensures that the function can handle edge cases gracefully without performing unnecessary computations.

**Note**: The do_nothing function is primarily used as a placeholder to maintain the structure of the code in scenarios where no action is required.

**Output Example**: If the input tensor x is a 2D tensor with values [[1, 2], [3, 4]], the return value of do_nothing(x) would be [[1, 2], [3, 4]].
## FunctionDef mps_gather_workaround(input, dim, index)
**mps_gather_workaround**: The function of mps_gather_workaround is to perform a gathering operation on a tensor while accommodating specific conditions related to the input tensor's shape.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· input: A tensor from which values are gathered.
· dim: The dimension along which to gather values.
· index: A tensor containing indices of the values to gather.

**Code Description**: The mps_gather_workaround function is designed to handle tensor gathering operations in a way that is optimized for scenarios where the input tensor has a specific shape. If the last dimension of the input tensor is equal to 1, the function first unsqueezes the input tensor and the index tensor to ensure they have compatible shapes for the gathering operation. It then adjusts the dimension parameter to account for negative indexing. The function utilizes the PyTorch `torch.gather` method to perform the gathering operation and subsequently squeezes the result to return a tensor of the appropriate shape. If the last dimension of the input tensor is not equal to 1, it directly applies `torch.gather` without any modifications.

This function is called within the bipartite_soft_matching_random2d function, which is responsible for partitioning tokens into source and destination groups and merging a specified number of tokens from the source to the destination. The mps_gather_workaround function is conditionally assigned to the variable `gather` based on the device type of the input tensor. If the device type is "mps" (Metal Performance Shaders), it uses mps_gather_workaround; otherwise, it defaults to the standard `torch.gather`. This integration allows for optimized performance on specific hardware while maintaining compatibility with standard operations.

**Note**: When using this function, it is important to ensure that the input tensor's shape aligns with the expected conditions, particularly regarding the last dimension. This will prevent unexpected behavior or errors during the gathering operation.

**Output Example**: For an input tensor of shape [2, 3, 1], a dimension of 1, and an index tensor of shape [2, 3], the output might look like a tensor of shape [2, 3] containing the gathered values from the input tensor based on the specified indices.
## FunctionDef bipartite_soft_matching_random2d(metric, w, h, sx, sy, r, no_rand)
**bipartite_soft_matching_random2d**: The function of bipartite_soft_matching_random2d is to partition tokens into source and destination groups and merge a specified number of tokens from the source to the destination.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· metric: A torch.Tensor of shape [B, N, C] representing the metric to use for similarity.
· w: An integer representing the image width in tokens.
· h: An integer representing the image height in tokens.
· sx: An integer representing the stride in the x dimension for destination tokens, which must divide w.
· sy: An integer representing the stride in the y dimension for destination tokens, which must divide h.
· r: An integer representing the number of tokens to remove (by merging).
· no_rand: A boolean flag that, if set to true, disables randomness and uses only the top left corner for selection.

**Code Description**: The bipartite_soft_matching_random2d function is designed to facilitate the merging of tokens in a bipartite manner based on a similarity metric. It begins by checking the dimensions of the input metric tensor and the parameters provided. If the number of tokens to remove (r) is less than or equal to zero, or if the width or height of the image is one, the function returns two instances of the do_nothing function, which serves as a placeholder for both merging and unmerging operations.

The function then determines the appropriate gathering method based on the device type of the input tensor, opting for mps_gather_workaround if the device is "mps" (Metal Performance Shaders), otherwise defaulting to the standard torch.gather method.

Next, the function calculates the number of destination tokens based on the provided strides (sx, sy) and partitions the tokens into source and destination groups. If randomness is disabled, it initializes the destination indices to the top left corner of the selected regions. The function then reshapes and prepares the index buffers to facilitate the gathering of source and destination tokens.

The core of the function computes the cosine similarity between the source and destination tokens and identifies the most similar tokens using a greedy approach. It then defines two inner functions: merge and unmerge. The merge function combines the selected source tokens into the destination tokens based on the specified merging mode (defaulting to "mean"), while the unmerge function reconstructs the original tensor shape by distributing the merged tokens back to their respective positions.

The bipartite_soft_matching_random2d function is called by the get_functions function, which is responsible for determining the appropriate merging and unmerging functions based on the input tensor's shape and the desired downsampling ratio. If the downsampling condition is met, it invokes bipartite_soft_matching_random2d to obtain the merge and unmerge functions; otherwise, it returns a no-operation lambda function.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the input tensor's shape and the parameters provided align with the expected conditions to avoid unexpected behavior or errors during execution.

**Output Example**: If the input tensor metric has a shape of [2, 16, 3] (representing 2 batches, 16 tokens, and 3 channels), and the parameters are set such that r = 4, the output of bipartite_soft_matching_random2d would be two callable functions: one for merging and one for unmerging the tokens based on the specified criteria.
### FunctionDef merge(x, mode)
**merge**: The function of merge is to combine source and destination tensors based on specified indices and a reduction mode.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· x: A torch.Tensor that contains the source and destination data to be merged.
· mode: A string that specifies the reduction method to be applied during the merge operation. The default value is "mean".

**Code Description**: The merge function takes a tensor `x` as input, which is expected to be structured in a way that it can be split into two components: `src` (source) and `dst` (destination). The function first splits the input tensor `x` into these two components using the `split` function. The shapes of the source tensor `src` are then extracted, where `n` represents the batch size, `t1` is the temporal dimension, and `c` is the channel dimension.

Next, the function gathers specific elements from the source tensor `src` based on the indices defined by `unm_idx` and `src_idx`. The `gather` function is used to select elements along the last dimension of `src`, effectively creating a new tensor `unm` that contains the unmapped elements and updating `src` to only include the mapped elements.

The destination tensor `dst` is then updated using the `scatter_reduce` method, which applies the specified reduction operation (defined by the `mode` parameter) to the gathered source tensor `src` at the indices specified by `dst_idx`. This operation modifies `dst` by reducing the values at the specified indices according to the chosen reduction method.

Finally, the function concatenates the unmapped tensor `unm` and the updated destination tensor `dst` along the temporal dimension (dim=1) and returns the resulting tensor.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the indices used in `gather` and `scatter_reduce` are correctly defined and match the expected dimensions of the source and destination tensors. The choice of reduction mode can significantly affect the output, so it should be selected based on the specific requirements of the application.

**Output Example**: An example output of the merge function could be a tensor of shape (n, t1, c) where the first part consists of unmapped elements and the second part consists of the reduced destination values, depending on the input tensor and the specified reduction mode. For instance, if `n=2`, `t1=5`, and `c=3`, the output could look like a tensor with dimensions (2, 5, 3) containing the merged values.
***
### FunctionDef unmerge(x)
**unmerge**: The function of unmerge is to rearrange and combine tensor data from a given input tensor based on specified indices.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· x: A torch.Tensor that contains the input data to be processed.

**Code Description**: The unmerge function takes a tensor `x` as input, which is expected to have a specific shape that includes a batch dimension and additional dimensions for data. The function first determines the length of the unm_idx tensor, which is used to split the input tensor into two parts: `unm` and `dst`. The `unm` tensor contains the first part of the input tensor up to `unm_len`, while `dst` contains the remaining part.

Next, the function gathers data from the `dst` tensor using the `dst_idx` indices, which are expanded to match the batch size and the required dimensions. This gathered data is stored in the `src` tensor.

The function then initializes an output tensor `out` filled with zeros, having the same device and data type as the input tensor `x`. The output tensor is structured to hold the combined data from the `unm`, `dst`, and `src` tensors.

The `scatter_` method is used multiple times to populate the `out` tensor. The first scatter operation inserts data from `dst` into the output tensor at positions specified by `b_idx`. The second scatter operation places data from `unm` at positions determined by the gathered indices from `unm_idx`. The final scatter operation fills in the `src` data at positions specified by `src_idx`.

The function ultimately returns the `out` tensor, which contains the rearranged and combined data from the input tensor `x`.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the input tensor `x` and the indices used (unm_idx, dst_idx, b_idx, a_idx, and src_idx) are correctly defined and compatible in terms of dimensions to avoid runtime errors.

**Output Example**: Given an input tensor `x` of shape (B, N, C) where B is the batch size, N is the number of elements, and C is the number of channels, the output tensor will also have the shape (B, N, C) but with the data rearranged according to the specified indices. For instance, if `x` is a tensor with values [[1, 2], [3, 4]] and the indices are set appropriately, the output might look like [[3, 4], [1, 2]].
***
### FunctionDef split(x)
**split**: The function of split is to separate a tensor into two distinct parts based on specified indices.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· x: A tensor of shape (B, N, C), where B is the batch size, N is the number of elements, and C is the number of channels or features.
· a_idx: An index tensor used to gather elements for the source part, with shape (B, N - num_dst).
· b_idx: An index tensor used to gather elements for the destination part, with shape (B, num_dst).
· num_dst: An integer representing the number of elements to be gathered for the destination part.

**Code Description**: The split function takes a tensor `x` and separates it into two components: `src` and `dst`. The variable `C` is assigned the size of the last dimension of `x`, which represents the number of channels. The function utilizes the `gather` operation to extract specific elements from `x` based on the indices provided by `a_idx` and `b_idx`. 

For the source component `src`, the function gathers elements along the second dimension (dim=1) of `x` using `a_idx`, which is expanded to match the batch size `B` and the number of elements `N - num_dst`. This results in a tensor that contains the selected elements for the source part. 

Similarly, for the destination component `dst`, the function gathers elements from `x` using `b_idx`, which is also expanded to match the batch size `B` and the number of elements `num_dst`. The function then returns both `src` and `dst` as a tuple.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the indices provided in `a_idx` and `b_idx` are valid and within the bounds of the dimensions of `x`. The function assumes that the input tensor `x` has been properly shaped and that the indices are correctly specified to avoid runtime errors.

**Output Example**: If `x` is a tensor of shape (2, 5, 3), `a_idx` is a tensor of shape (2, 3), and `b_idx` is a tensor of shape (2, 2), the output could be:
- src: A tensor of shape (2, 3, 3) containing the gathered elements for the source.
- dst: A tensor of shape (2, 2, 3) containing the gathered elements for the destination.
***
## FunctionDef get_functions(x, ratio, original_shape)
**get_functions**: The function of get_functions is to determine appropriate merging and unmerging functions based on the input tensor's shape and the desired downsampling ratio.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· x: A torch.Tensor representing the input tensor, typically of shape [B, N, C], where B is the batch size, N is the number of tokens, and C is the number of channels.
· ratio: A float representing the ratio of tokens to retain after merging.
· original_shape: A tuple containing four integers (b, c, original_h, original_w) that represent the batch size, number of channels, original height, and original width of the input tensor.

**Code Description**: The get_functions function is designed to facilitate the selection of merging and unmerging operations based on the input tensor's dimensions and the specified downsampling ratio. It begins by unpacking the original_shape parameter into its constituent dimensions: batch size (b), number of channels (c), original height (original_h), and original width (original_w). The function calculates the total number of tokens in the original tensor and determines the downsampling factor based on the input tensor's shape and the total number of tokens.

If the calculated downsampling factor is less than or equal to the maximum allowed downsampling (which is set to 1), the function computes the new width (w) and height (h) of the downsampled tensor. It then calculates the number of tokens to retain (r) based on the provided ratio. The function then calls the bipartite_soft_matching_random2d function, passing the input tensor and the calculated dimensions and parameters. This function is responsible for partitioning the tokens into source and destination groups and merging a specified number of tokens from the source to the destination.

If the downsampling condition is not met, the function returns two instances of a no-operation lambda function, effectively indicating that no merging or unmerging will occur.

The get_functions function is called by the tomesd_m function within the TomePatchModel class. In this context, get_functions is invoked with the query tensor (q) from the transformer block, along with a ratio and additional options that include the original shape of the input tensor. The merging function (m) returned by get_functions is then applied to the query tensor, while the key (k) and value (v) tensors are passed through unchanged.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the input tensor's shape and the parameters provided align with the expected conditions to avoid unexpected behavior or errors during execution.

**Output Example**: If the input tensor x has a shape of [2, 16, 3] (representing 2 batches, 16 tokens, and 3 channels), and the parameters are set such that ratio = 0.5 and original_shape = (2, 3, 4, 4), the output of get_functions would be two callable functions: one for merging and one for unmerging the tokens based on the specified criteria.
## ClassDef TomePatchModel
**TomePatchModel**: The function of TomePatchModel is to apply a patch to a model's attention mechanism using a specified ratio.

**attributes**: The attributes of this Class.
· INPUT_TYPES: Defines the required input types for the patch method, including a model and a ratio.
· RETURN_TYPES: Specifies the return type of the patch method, which is a modified model.
· FUNCTION: Indicates the name of the method that performs the main functionality, which is "patch".
· CATEGORY: Categorizes the class under "_for_testing".

**Code Description**: The TomePatchModel class is designed to modify the attention mechanism of a given model. It contains a class method `INPUT_TYPES` that specifies the inputs required for the patching process. The inputs include a model of type "MODEL" and a ratio of type "FLOAT", which has a default value of 0.3 and is constrained to a range between 0.0 and 1.0 with a step of 0.01. The class also defines a return type of "MODEL", indicating that the output will be a modified version of the input model.

The core functionality of the class is encapsulated in the `patch` method. This method takes two parameters: `model`, which is the model to be patched, and `ratio`, which determines the extent of the patching. Within the `patch` method, a variable `self.u` is initialized to None. Two inner functions are defined: `tomesd_m` and `tomesd_u`. 

The `tomesd_m` function is responsible for modifying the model's attention mechanism. It utilizes a helper function `get_functions`, which is called with the query `q`, the specified `ratio`, and additional options that include the original shape of the model. The output of `get_functions` is assigned to `m` and `self.u`. The function then returns a tuple containing the modified query `m(q)`, along with the original key `k` and value `v`.

The `tomesd_u` function is designed to handle the output of the modified attention mechanism, utilizing the `self.u` variable.

The model is cloned using the `clone` method, and the attention mechanism is patched by setting the model's attention functions to the inner functions `tomesd_m` and `tomesd_u`. Finally, the patched model is returned as a single-element tuple.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the model being patched is compatible with the modifications being applied. The ratio parameter should be chosen carefully to achieve the desired effect on the model's performance.

**Output Example**: A possible appearance of the code's return value would be a modified model that retains the original structure but has altered attention mechanisms, allowing for different behavior during inference or training. The output would be represented as a tuple containing the patched model, for example: `(modified_model,)`.
### FunctionDef INPUT_TYPES(s)
**INPUT_TYPES**: The function of INPUT_TYPES is to define and return the required input types for a model configuration.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· parameter1: s - This parameter is a placeholder that is not utilized within the function's logic.

**Code Description**: The INPUT_TYPES function constructs and returns a dictionary that specifies the required input types for a model. The returned dictionary contains a single key, "required", which itself maps to another dictionary. This inner dictionary defines two required inputs: "model" and "ratio". 

- The "model" input is expected to be of type "MODEL", indicating that it should conform to a predefined model type.
- The "ratio" input is of type "FLOAT" and includes additional constraints: it has a default value of 0.3, a minimum value of 0.0, a maximum value of 1.0, and a step increment of 0.01. These constraints ensure that the ratio input is a floating-point number within the specified range and adheres to the defined step size for adjustments.

This structured approach allows for clear validation and ensures that the inputs provided to the model are both necessary and correctly formatted.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the inputs conform to the specified types and constraints when utilizing this function, as improper values may lead to errors in model configuration or execution.

**Output Example**: A possible appearance of the code's return value could be:
{
    "required": {
        "model": ("MODEL",),
        "ratio": ("FLOAT", {"default": 0.3, "min": 0.0, "max": 1.0, "step": 0.01})
    }
}
***
### FunctionDef patch(self, model, ratio)
**patch**: The function of patch is to modify a given model by applying custom attention mechanisms based on the provided ratio and additional options.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· parameter1: model - The model instance that is to be patched with new attention mechanisms.
· parameter2: ratio - A numerical value used to adjust the behavior of the attention mechanisms.

**Code Description**: The patch function begins by initializing an attribute `self.u` to None. It defines two inner functions: `tomesd_m` and `tomesd_u`. The `tomesd_m` function is responsible for modifying the attention mechanism of the model. It takes three inputs: `q`, `k`, and `v`, which represent the query, key, and value tensors, respectively, along with `extra_options` that may contain additional configuration parameters. Within this function, it calls `get_functions` with `q`, `ratio`, and the original shape from `extra_options`, which returns a modified attention mechanism `m` and updates `self.u`. The function then returns the modified output of `m(q)` along with the original `k` and `v`.

The second inner function, `tomesd_u`, utilizes the previously computed `self.u` to process an input `n` and return the result. 

After defining these inner functions, the patch function clones the provided model to create a new instance `m`. It then sets the modified attention mechanism and output functions on this cloned model using `set_model_attn1_patch` and `set_model_attn1_output_patch`, respectively. Finally, the function returns a tuple containing the modified model.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the `extra_options` dictionary contains the key "original_shape" to avoid runtime errors. Additionally, the behavior of the patched model may vary based on the value of `ratio` and the implementation of `get_functions`.

**Output Example**: A possible return value of the patch function could be a tuple containing the modified model instance, which now has the custom attention mechanisms applied. For instance, the output might look like: `(ModifiedModelInstance,)`.
#### FunctionDef tomesd_m(q, k, v, extra_options)
**tomesd_m**: The function of tomesd_m is to apply a merging function to the query tensor while returning the unchanged key and value tensors.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· q: A torch.Tensor representing the query tensor, typically used in transformer models. 
· k: A torch.Tensor representing the key tensor, which is passed through unchanged.
· v: A torch.Tensor representing the value tensor, which is also passed through unchanged.
· extra_options: A dictionary containing additional options, including the original shape of the input tensor.

**Code Description**: The tomesd_m function is designed to facilitate the processing of the query tensor (q) in a transformer block by applying a specific merging function derived from the input tensor's characteristics. The function begins by invoking the get_functions method, which is responsible for determining the appropriate merging and unmerging functions based on the query tensor, a specified downsampling ratio, and the original shape of the input tensor provided in the extra_options parameter.

In this context, the get_functions function is called with the query tensor (q), a ratio (which is assumed to be defined elsewhere in the code), and the original shape extracted from extra_options. The get_functions function returns two callable functions: one for merging (m) and one for unmerging (self.u). The merging function (m) is then applied to the query tensor (q), while the key tensor (k) and value tensor (v) are returned unchanged.

This design allows for flexibility in processing the query tensor while maintaining the integrity of the key and value tensors, which are essential components in the attention mechanism of transformer architectures. The choice to use the query tensor as the input for get_functions, instead of the typical input tensor (x), is noted to yield better results based on preliminary testing.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the parameters passed to the tomesd_m function, particularly the extra_options containing the original shape, are correctly defined to avoid unexpected behavior during execution.

**Output Example**: If the input query tensor q has a shape of [2, 16, 3] (representing 2 batches, 16 tokens, and 3 channels), the output of tomesd_m would be a tuple containing the processed query tensor after applying the merging function, along with the unchanged key and value tensors: (processed_q, k, v).
***
#### FunctionDef tomesd_u(n, extra_options)
**tomesd_u**: The function of tomesd_u is to return the value of the instance variable u for a given input n.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· parameter1: n - This parameter is expected to be an input value that is used to retrieve the corresponding value from the instance variable u.
· parameter2: extra_options - This parameter is intended for additional options that may influence the behavior of the function, although it is not utilized within the current implementation.

**Code Description**: The tomesd_u function is a method that takes two parameters: n and extra_options. The function primarily focuses on returning the value of the instance variable u, which is accessed through the method self.u(n). The parameter n is passed directly to this method, indicating that it is likely used to index or determine a specific value from u. The extra_options parameter is included in the function signature, suggesting that it may be intended for future enhancements or additional functionality, but it is not currently utilized in the function's logic.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the instance variable u is properly defined and that the method self.u(n) is implemented correctly to avoid runtime errors. Additionally, while extra_options is included as a parameter, developers should be aware that it does not affect the current functionality of the tomesd_u method.

**Output Example**: If the instance variable u is defined as a list or an array, and n is an integer index, the return value of tomesd_u could be the element at that index. For example, if u = [10, 20, 30] and n = 1, the output would be 20.
