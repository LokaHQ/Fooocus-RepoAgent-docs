### FunctionDef merge(self, model1, model2)
**merge**: The function of merge is to combine two models by applying key patches from the second model to a cloned version of the first model based on specified ratios.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· model1: The first model from which a clone will be created.
· model2: The second model from which key patches will be extracted.
· kwargs: Additional keyword arguments that specify the ratios for merging specific patches.

**Code Description**: The merge function begins by creating a clone of model1, ensuring that the original model remains unaltered. It then retrieves key patches from model2 that are prefixed with "diffusion_model." The function expects that the first value in kwargs will provide a default merging ratio. 

For each key patch retrieved, the function initializes the merging ratio to the default. It then iterates through the keys in kwargs to check if the current key patch (after removing the "diffusion_model." prefix) starts with any of the keys in kwargs. If a match is found, the ratio is updated to the corresponding value from kwargs, ensuring that the most specific ratio is used.

The function then applies the patches to the cloned model using the add_patches method, where it specifies the ratio of the original model's patch to the new patch being added. The merging process is executed with the calculated ratios, effectively blending the two models based on the specified parameters. Finally, the function returns a tuple containing the modified model.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the keys in kwargs are structured correctly to match the prefixes of the key patches. The function assumes that at least one ratio is provided in kwargs; otherwise, it may lead to unexpected behavior.

**Output Example**: A possible return value of the merge function could be a tuple containing the merged model, represented as (merged_model_instance,). The merged_model_instance would reflect the combined characteristics of model1 and model2 based on the applied patches and ratios.

· clip: An optional parameter representing the CLIP model used for image processing.
· vae: An optional parameter representing the Variational Autoencoder model.
· clip_vision: An optional parameter representing the vision component of the CLIP model.
· filename_prefix: A string that serves as the base name for the checkpoint file to be saved.
· output_dir: A string representing the directory where the checkpoint file will be saved.
· prompt: An optional string that contains the prompt information related to the model's operation.
· extra_pnginfo: An optional dictionary that can include additional metadata to be saved alongside the checkpoint.

**Code Description**: The save_checkpoint function is designed to facilitate the saving of model checkpoints in a structured manner. It begins by generating a valid file path for saving the checkpoint using the get_save_image_path function, which ensures that the path adheres to specified constraints and formats. This function returns several components, including the full output folder, the base filename, a counter for versioning, the subfolder, and the processed filename prefix.

The function then prepares metadata that describes the model being saved. It checks the type of model (SDXL or SDXLRefiner) and populates the metadata dictionary with relevant information such as the architecture, implementation details, and a title that includes the filename and counter. Depending on the model type, it also sets a specific prediction key (either "epsilon" or "v") in the metadata.

If server information is not disabled, the function adds the prompt information and any extra PNG information to the metadata. This ensures that all relevant context is preserved alongside the model state.

Finally, the function constructs the full path for the checkpoint file and calls the save_checkpoint method from the ldm_patched.modules.sd module to perform the actual saving of the model state, along with the associated metadata.

The save_checkpoint function is called by other components within the project, such as the save method in the CheckpointSave class and the ImageOnlyCheckpointSave class. These classes utilize save_checkpoint to ensure that the model's state is saved correctly, along with any relevant metadata, allowing for easy restoration and management of model states during training or inference.

**Note**: It is essential to ensure that the output directory is correctly specified to avoid errors related to invalid paths. Additionally, the filename prefix should be formatted appropriately to ensure that the saved files are organized and do not conflict with existing files.
## ClassDef CheckpointSave
**CheckpointSave**: The function of CheckpointSave is to facilitate the saving of model checkpoints in a structured manner.

**attributes**: The attributes of this Class.
· output_dir: This attribute holds the directory path where the model checkpoints will be saved, obtained through the utility function `get_output_directory()` from the `ldm_patched.utils.path_utils` module.

**Code Description**: The CheckpointSave class is designed to manage the saving of model checkpoints, which is a crucial aspect in machine learning workflows for preserving the state of models during training or evaluation. Upon initialization, the class retrieves the output directory where the checkpoints will be stored. 

The class defines a class method `INPUT_TYPES`, which specifies the required and hidden input types for the saving operation. The required inputs include:
- model: The model to be saved, identified as a "MODEL".
- clip: A component associated with the model, identified as a "CLIP".
- vae: Variational Autoencoder component, identified as "VAE".
- filename_prefix: A string that serves as a prefix for the checkpoint filename, with a default value of "checkpoints/ldm_patched".

The hidden inputs include:
- prompt: An optional prompt that may be associated with the checkpoint.
- extra_pnginfo: Additional PNG information that may be relevant to the checkpoint.

The class also defines a method `save`, which is responsible for executing the checkpoint saving process. This method takes the required inputs and optional parameters, and it calls the `save_checkpoint` function, passing along the necessary arguments to save the model's state to the specified output directory.

The CheckpointSave class is extended by the ImageOnlyCheckpointSave class, which modifies the `save` method to accommodate a different input type for the clip component, specifically `clip_vision`. This indicates that the ImageOnlyCheckpointSave class is tailored for scenarios where only image-related checkpoints are relevant, while still leveraging the foundational functionality provided by the CheckpointSave class.

**Note**: When using the CheckpointSave class, ensure that the required model components are correctly instantiated and passed to the `save` method to avoid runtime errors. The output directory must also be accessible for writing files.
