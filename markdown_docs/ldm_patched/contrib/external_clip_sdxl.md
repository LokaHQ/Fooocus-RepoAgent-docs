**CLIPTextEncodeSDXLRefiner**: The function of CLIPTextEncodeSDXLRefiner is to encode text input into a conditioning format suitable for advanced applications using a CLIP model.

**attributes**: The attributes of this Class.
· ascore: A floating-point number representing the aesthetic score, with a default value of 6.0, and constrained between 0.0 and 1000.0 with a step of 0.01.
· width: An integer representing the width of the output, with a default value of 1024, constrained between 0 and a predefined maximum resolution.
· height: An integer representing the height of the output, with a default value of 1024, constrained between 0 and a predefined maximum resolution.
· text: A string input that can be multiline, representing the text to be encoded.
· clip: An instance of a CLIP model used for tokenization and encoding.

**Code Description**: The CLIPTextEncodeSDXLRefiner class is designed to facilitate the encoding of text into a format that can be used for conditioning in advanced machine learning applications. The class provides a class method `INPUT_TYPES` that specifies the required input types for the encoding process. This includes parameters for aesthetic score, dimensions (width and height), the text to be encoded, and a CLIP model instance. The `RETURN_TYPES` attribute indicates that the output will be of type "CONDITIONING". The core functionality is encapsulated in the `encode` method, which takes the specified inputs, tokenizes the text using the provided CLIP model, and encodes the tokens to produce a conditioning output. The method returns a structured output containing the conditioning data along with additional metadata such as pooled output, aesthetic score, width, and height.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the input parameters adhere to the specified constraints to avoid runtime errors. The aesthetic score should be a floating-point number within the defined range, and the width and height should be integers that do not exceed the maximum resolution.

**Output Example**: A possible return value from the `encode` method could look like this:
```
[
    [
        conditioning_data, 
        {
            "pooled_output": pooled_output_data, 
            "aesthetic_score": 6.0, 
            "width": 1024, 
            "height": 1024
        }
    ]
]
``` 
Where `conditioning_data` represents the encoded conditioning output and `pooled_output_data` is the result of the pooling operation from the CLIP model.
### FunctionDef INPUT_TYPES(s)
**INPUT_TYPES**: The function of INPUT_TYPES is to define and return the required input types and their constraints for a specific processing function.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· parameter1: s - This parameter is a placeholder for any input that may be passed to the function, although it is not utilized within the function body.

**Code Description**: The INPUT_TYPES function constructs a dictionary that specifies the required input types for a particular operation. The dictionary contains a single key, "required", which maps to another dictionary detailing the expected inputs. Each input is defined by a tuple consisting of the input type and a dictionary of constraints. 

The inputs defined are as follows:
- "ascore": This input expects a FLOAT type value. It has a default value of 6.0 and constraints that specify it must be between 0.0 and 1000.0, with increments of 0.01.
- "width": This input expects an INT type value. The default value is set to 1024, with constraints that require it to be a non-negative integer and not exceed a predefined constant MAX_RESOLUTION.
- "height": Similar to "width", this input also expects an INT type value with the same default and constraints.
- "text": This input expects a STRING type value, which allows for multiline input.
- "clip": This input expects a CLIP type value, which does not have additional constraints specified.

The function effectively standardizes the input requirements for subsequent processing, ensuring that all necessary parameters are provided in the correct format and within specified limits.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the values provided for "ascore", "width", and "height" adhere to their respective constraints to avoid errors during processing. The "text" input should be formatted correctly to support multiline entries.

**Output Example**: A possible appearance of the code's return value could be:
{
    "required": {
        "ascore": ("FLOAT", {"default": 6.0, "min": 0.0, "max": 1000.0, "step": 0.01}),
        "width": ("INT", {"default": 1024, "min": 0, "max": MAX_RESOLUTION}),
        "height": ("INT", {"default": 1024, "min": 0, "max": MAX_RESOLUTION}),
        "text": ("STRING", {"multiline": True}),
        "clip": ("CLIP", )
    }
}

### FunctionDef encode(self, clip, ascore, width, height, text)
**encode**: The function of encode is to process text input and generate a structured output containing encoded representations and associated metadata.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· clip: An instance of a CLIP model used for tokenization and encoding of the input text.
· ascore: Aesthetic score associated with the input text, which is included in the output for further analysis.
· width: The width dimension related to the input, potentially for image generation or processing.
· height: The height dimension related to the input, potentially for image generation or processing.
· text: The input text that needs to be tokenized and encoded.

**Code Description**: The encode function begins by taking the input text and utilizing the clip instance to tokenize it. Tokenization is the process of converting the text into a format that can be processed by the CLIP model. After tokenization, the function calls the encode_from_tokens method of the clip instance, passing the tokens as an argument. This method encodes the tokens and returns two outputs: 'cond', which represents the conditional encoding of the input text, and 'pooled', which is a pooled representation of the encoded tokens. The function then constructs a return value that is a list containing a single tuple. This tuple consists of the conditional encoding 'cond' and a dictionary that includes the pooled output, aesthetic score, width, and height. This structured output allows for easy access to both the encoded representation and the associated metadata.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the input text is appropriately formatted for tokenization. The aesthetic score, width, and height should be provided in a compatible format to avoid errors during processing. The function assumes that the clip instance is already initialized and ready for use.

**Output Example**: A possible appearance of the code's return value could be:
[
    [
        cond_encoding_array, 
        {
            "pooled_output": pooled_encoding_array, 
            "aesthetic_score": 0.85, 
            "width": 512, 
            "height": 512
        }
    ]
] 
In this example, 'cond_encoding_array' and 'pooled_encoding_array' represent the actual encoded outputs generated by the CLIP model, while the aesthetic score and dimensions are provided as numerical values.

· text_l: A string input for the second text prompt, which can be multiline and defaults to "CLIP_L".
· clip: An instance of the CLIP model used for tokenization and encoding.

**Code Description**: The CLIPTextEncodeSDXL class is designed to facilitate the encoding of text inputs into a format suitable for conditioning in advanced applications. The class provides a class method, INPUT_TYPES, which defines the required input types and their constraints, including dimensions for image processing and text prompts. The encode method takes several parameters, including the CLIP model instance and various dimensions, to perform the encoding. Inside the encode method, the text prompts are tokenized, and their lengths are adjusted to ensure they match. If the lengths differ, empty tokens are appended to balance them. The method then encodes the tokens using the CLIP model and returns a structured output containing the conditioning data and additional metadata about the image dimensions.

**Note**: When using this class, ensure that the input dimensions do not exceed the defined MAX_RESOLUTION. Additionally, the text inputs should be carefully managed to maintain consistency in length for effective encoding.

**Output Example**: A possible return value from the encode method could look like this:
[
    [
        conditioning_data,
        {
            "pooled_output": pooled_output_data,
            "width": 1024,
            "height": 1024,
            "crop_w": 0,
            "crop_h": 0,
            "target_width": 1024,
            "target_height": 1024
        }
    ]
] 
Where `conditioning_data` represents the encoded conditioning information and `pooled_output_data` contains the pooled output from the encoding process.
### FunctionDef INPUT_TYPES(s)
**INPUT_TYPES**: The function of INPUT_TYPES is to define and return the required input types and their constraints for a specific configuration.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· s: This parameter is not utilized within the function body but is typically included for compatibility with other similar functions or frameworks.

**Code Description**: The INPUT_TYPES function constructs a dictionary that specifies the required input parameters for a certain process. The dictionary contains a single key, "required", which maps to another dictionary detailing the specific parameters needed. Each parameter is defined with its type and additional constraints:

- "width": An integer representing the width, with a default value of 1024.0, and constraints that it must be between 0 and a defined constant MAX_RESOLUTION.
- "height": Similar to "width", this integer represents the height, also defaulting to 1024.0, with the same constraints.
- "crop_w": An integer for the crop width, defaulting to 0, with constraints of being non-negative and not exceeding MAX_RESOLUTION.
- "crop_h": An integer for the crop height, defaulting to 0, with the same constraints as "crop_w".
- "target_width": An integer for the target width, defaulting to 1024.0, with constraints similar to "width".
- "target_height": An integer for the target height, defaulting to 1024.0, with constraints similar to "height".
- "text_g": A string that allows multiline input, defaulting to "CLIP_G".
- "clip": A parameter of type "CLIP", which is likely a custom type defined elsewhere in the code.
- "text_l": Another string allowing multiline input, defaulting to "CLIP_L".
- "clip": Another parameter of type "CLIP", similar to the previous "clip" entry.

This structured approach ensures that all necessary inputs are clearly defined, along with their expected types and constraints, facilitating validation and error handling in the broader application.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the values provided for width, height, crop_w, crop_h, target_width, and target_height fall within the specified range to avoid runtime errors. The use of the "CLIP" type for the clip parameters suggests that additional handling or processing may be required for these inputs.

**Output Example**: A possible appearance of the code's return value could be:
{
    "required": {
        "width": ("INT", {"default": 1024.0, "min": 0, "max": MAX_RESOLUTION}),
        "height": ("INT", {"default": 1024.0, "min": 0, "max": MAX_RESOLUTION}),
        "crop_w": ("INT", {"default": 0, "min": 0, "max": MAX_RESOLUTION}),
        "crop_h": ("INT", {"default": 0, "min": 0, "max": MAX_RESOLUTION}),
        "target_width": ("INT", {"default": 1024.0, "min": 0, "max": MAX_RESOLUTION}),
        "target_height": ("INT", {"default": 1024.0, "min": 0, "max": MAX_RESOLUTION}),
        "text_g": ("STRING", {"multiline": True, "default": "CLIP_G"}),
        "clip": ("CLIP", ),
        "text_l": ("STRING", {"multiline": True, "default": "CLIP_L"}),
        "clip": ("CLIP", ),
    }
}

### FunctionDef encode(self, clip, width, height, crop_w, crop_h, target_width, target_height, text_g, text_l)
**encode**: The function of encode is to process and encode text inputs into a format suitable for further use in a CLIP model.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· clip: An instance of the CLIP model used for tokenization and encoding.
· width: The width of the output image or representation.
· height: The height of the output image or representation.
· crop_w: The width of the cropped area.
· crop_h: The height of the cropped area.
· target_width: The desired width for the output.
· target_height: The desired height for the output.
· text_g: The primary text input to be encoded.
· text_l: The secondary text input to be encoded.

**Code Description**: The encode function begins by tokenizing the primary text input (text_g) using the provided CLIP model instance. It then tokenizes the secondary text input (text_l) and assigns its tokens to the corresponding key in the tokens dictionary. If the lengths of the tokenized lists for text_g and text_l do not match, the function will pad the shorter list with empty tokens until both lists are of equal length. This ensures that the encoding process can proceed without errors related to mismatched input sizes. After preparing the tokens, the function calls the encode_from_tokens method of the CLIP model to obtain the encoded representation (cond) and a pooled output (pooled). Finally, the function returns a structured output containing the encoded representation along with a dictionary of metadata, including dimensions and cropping information.

**Note**: It is essential to ensure that the text inputs are appropriately formatted and that the CLIP model is correctly initialized before calling this function. The function assumes that the CLIP model can handle the tokenization and encoding processes without additional configuration.

**Output Example**: A possible appearance of the code's return value could be:
[
    [
        encoded_representation, 
        {
            "pooled_output": pooled_output, 
            "width": 512, 
            "height": 512, 
            "crop_w": 256, 
            "crop_h": 256, 
            "target_width": 512, 
            "target_height": 512
        }
    ]
