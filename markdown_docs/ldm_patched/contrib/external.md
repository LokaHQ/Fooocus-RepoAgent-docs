## FunctionDef before_node_execution
**before_node_execution**: The function of before_node_execution is to check for any interruptions in processing before executing a node in a processing pipeline.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· None

**Code Description**: The before_node_execution function is designed to ensure that any ongoing processing tasks are monitored for interruptions prior to the execution of a node. It achieves this by invoking the throw_exception_if_processing_interrupted function from the model_management module. This call serves as a safeguard, allowing the system to verify whether an interruption has been requested by the user or the system itself.

The throw_exception_if_processing_interrupted function operates by checking a global state variable, interrupt_processing, which indicates if an interruption is required. It utilizes a mutex, interrupt_processing_mutex, to ensure that this check is performed in a thread-safe manner, preventing potential race conditions in a multi-threaded environment. If an interruption is detected, the function raises an InterruptProcessingException, signaling that the processing operation should be halted.

The relationship between before_node_execution and throw_exception_if_processing_interrupted is critical for maintaining the responsiveness of the processing system. By calling throw_exception_if_processing_interrupted, before_node_execution ensures that any requests for interruption are acknowledged before proceeding with the execution of the node. This mechanism is essential for managing user commands and maintaining control over lengthy processing tasks.

In summary, before_node_execution acts as a preparatory function that checks for interruptions, thereby enhancing the robustness and responsiveness of the overall processing workflow.

**Note**: It is important to handle the InterruptProcessingException appropriately in the calling context to maintain the integrity of the processing flow and ensure a smooth user experience.
## FunctionDef interrupt_processing(value)
**interrupt_processing**: The function of interrupt_processing is to control the interruption of ongoing processing tasks by invoking the interrupt_current_processing function with a specified boolean value.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· value: A boolean value that determines whether to interrupt the current processing. The default is True.

**Code Description**: The interrupt_processing function serves as a wrapper that calls the interrupt_current_processing function from the model_management module. By default, it sets the value parameter to True, indicating that the current processing should be interrupted. When invoked, this function directly interacts with the global state of the application by modifying the interrupt_processing variable through the interrupt_current_processing function.

The interrupt_current_processing function is responsible for managing the interruption of ongoing tasks by utilizing a mutex to ensure thread safety. This is critical in a multi-threaded environment where multiple threads may attempt to modify the same global variable concurrently. The interrupt_processing function, therefore, acts as a straightforward interface for other components of the application to signal an interruption in processing without needing to directly manage the mutex or the global variable.

This function is typically called in scenarios where a task needs to be halted, such as in response to user actions or specific conditions within the application. By providing a simple interface, it allows for consistent handling of task interruptions across different modules, enhancing the overall control over task execution.

**Note**: It is essential to use the interrupt_processing function judiciously to avoid unintended interruptions in processing. Developers should ensure that the function is called in appropriate contexts where an interruption is warranted, maintaining the integrity of ongoing tasks.

· RETURN_TYPES: Defines the type of output returned by the encode function, which is a conditioning output.
· FUNCTION: Indicates the name of the function that performs the encoding, which is "encode".
· CATEGORY: Classifies the functionality of this class under "conditioning".

**Code Description**: The CLIPTextEncode class is designed to facilitate the encoding of text using a CLIP (Contrastive Language–Image Pre-training) model. It provides a class method called INPUT_TYPES that outlines the necessary input parameters for the encoding process. The required inputs are a text string, which can be multiline, and a CLIP model instance. The class also specifies that the output of the encoding process will be of type "CONDITIONING". 

The core functionality is encapsulated in the encode method, which takes two parameters: clip and text. Within this method, the text is first tokenized using the clip's tokenize method. This tokenization converts the input text into a format suitable for the CLIP model. Subsequently, the method calls clip's encode_from_tokens function, passing the tokenized text and requesting the pooled output. This function returns two outputs: cond, which represents the conditioning output, and pooled, which is an additional representation of the encoded text. Finally, the encode method returns a structured output containing the conditioning output and the pooled output in a specific format.

**Note**: When using this class, ensure that the input text is properly formatted as a string and that a valid CLIP model instance is provided. The encode method is expected to be called with these parameters to obtain the desired encoding results.

**Output Example**: An example of the return value from the encode method might look like this:
```
[
    [
        cond_output, 
        {"pooled_output": pooled_output}
    ]
]
```
Where `cond_output` is the conditioning output from the CLIP model and `pooled_output` is the additional representation of the encoded text.
### FunctionDef INPUT_TYPES(s)
**INPUT_TYPES**: The function of INPUT_TYPES is to define and return the required input types for a specific operation involving text and CLIP.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· parameter1: s - This parameter is not utilized within the function but is included to maintain a consistent function signature.

**Code Description**: The INPUT_TYPES function is designed to return a dictionary that specifies the required input types for a particular process. The function constructs a dictionary with a single key "required", which itself maps to another dictionary. This inner dictionary contains two keys: "text" and "clip". The "text" key is associated with a tuple that specifies its type as "STRING" and includes an additional specification that allows for multiline input (indicated by the value `{"multiline": True}`). The "clip" key is associated with a tuple that specifies its type as "CLIP", indicating that this input is expected to conform to the CLIP format. This structured return value is essential for ensuring that the inputs provided to the function or operation are correctly formatted and meet the necessary criteria for processing.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the inputs provided match the specified types, as this will facilitate proper handling and processing of the data. The "text" input should be a string that can span multiple lines, while the "clip" input must adhere to the CLIP format.

**Output Example**: A possible appearance of the code's return value could be:
{
    "required": {
        "text": ("STRING", {"multiline": True}),
        "clip": ("CLIP", )
    }
}
***
### FunctionDef encode(self, clip, text)
**encode**: The function of encode is to process and encode a given text using a specified CLIP model.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· clip: An instance of a CLIP model that provides methods for tokenization and encoding.
· text: A string input that represents the text to be encoded.

**Code Description**: The encode function takes two parameters: a CLIP model instance and a text string. It first utilizes the `tokenize` method of the provided CLIP model to convert the input text into tokens, which are a numerical representation suitable for processing by the model. Following this, it calls the `encode_from_tokens` method of the CLIP model, passing the generated tokens. This method encodes the tokens and returns two outputs: `cond`, which represents the encoded conditional output, and `pooled`, which is a pooled representation of the encoded tokens. The function then returns a structured output containing the conditional encoding and the pooled output in a specific format, which is a tuple containing a list with the conditional output and a dictionary that includes the pooled output.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the input text is properly formatted and that the CLIP model instance is correctly initialized before calling this function. The function is designed to handle single text inputs and may require adjustments for batch processing.

**Output Example**: An example of the return value from the encode function could look like this:
```
[
    [
        <encoded_conditional_output>, 
        {"pooled_output": <encoded_pooled_output>}
    ]
]
```
In this output, `<encoded_conditional_output>` and `<encoded_pooled_output>` would be the respective encoded representations generated by the CLIP model.

***
### FunctionDef combine(self, conditioning_1, conditioning_2)
**combine**: The function of combine is to concatenate two conditioning inputs into a single tuple.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· parameter1: conditioning_1 - The first conditioning input, which is expected to be a type that supports addition (e.g., a string, list, or numeric type).
· parameter2: conditioning_2 - The second conditioning input, which is also expected to be a type that supports addition.

**Code Description**: The combine function takes two parameters, conditioning_1 and conditioning_2, and returns a tuple containing the result of their addition. The addition operation is performed using the '+' operator, which means that the types of conditioning_1 and conditioning_2 must be compatible for addition. The function wraps the result of the addition in a tuple, ensuring that the output is always a single-element tuple regardless of the types of the inputs. This design allows for flexibility in the types of inputs that can be combined, as long as they support the addition operation.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that both conditioning_1 and conditioning_2 are of compatible types to avoid runtime errors. If the types do not support addition, a TypeError will be raised. Users should also be aware that the output will always be a tuple, even if the result of the addition is a single value.

**Output Example**: If conditioning_1 is "Hello, " and conditioning_2 is "World!", the function will return the tuple ("Hello, World!",). If conditioning_1 is [1, 2] and conditioning_2 is [3, 4], the function will return the tuple ([1, 2, 3, 4],).
***
## ClassDef ConditioningAverage
**ConditioningAverage**: The function of ConditioningAverage is to compute a weighted average of conditioning inputs.

**attributes**: The attributes of this Class.
· INPUT_TYPES: Defines the required input types for the class method.
· RETURN_TYPES: Specifies the type of output returned by the class method.
· FUNCTION: Indicates the name of the function that will be executed.
· CATEGORY: Categorizes the functionality of the class.

**Code Description**: The ConditioningAverage class is designed to facilitate the averaging of conditioning data by applying a weighted combination of two conditioning inputs. It provides a class method INPUT_TYPES that outlines the necessary inputs for its functionality. The method requires two conditioning inputs, `conditioning_to` and `conditioning_from`, both of which are expected to be of type "CONDITIONING". Additionally, it accepts a `conditioning_to_strength` parameter, which is a floating-point number that determines the weight of the `conditioning_to` input in the final output. The method returns a tuple containing the averaged conditioning data.

The core functionality is implemented in the `addWeighted` method, which takes the specified conditioning inputs and the strength parameter. It first checks if there is more than one conditioning input in `conditioning_from` and issues a warning if so, indicating that only the first conditioning input will be used. The method then processes each conditioning input in `conditioning_to`, performing the following steps:

1. It retrieves the first conditioning input from `conditioning_from` and its associated pooled output.
2. For each conditioning input in `conditioning_to`, it computes a weighted average using the specified `conditioning_to_strength`. If the shapes of the conditioning tensors do not match, it pads the smaller tensor with zeros to ensure compatibility.
3. The method also handles the pooled output, applying the same weighted average logic if both pooled outputs are available.
4. Finally, it compiles the results into a list and returns it as a tuple.

This class is particularly useful in scenarios where conditioning data needs to be blended based on varying strengths, allowing for more nuanced control over the conditioning process.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the conditioning inputs are correctly formatted and that the `conditioning_to_strength` parameter is within the specified range (0.0 to 1.0) to avoid unexpected behavior.

**Output Example**: A possible appearance of the code's return value could be:
```
[
    [tensor([[0.5, 0.5], [0.5, 0.5]]), {"pooled_output": tensor([[0.6, 0.6], [0.6, 0.6]])}],
    [tensor([[0.7, 0.3], [0.7, 0.3]]), {"pooled_output": tensor([[0.8, 0.2], [0.8, 0.2]])}]
]
```
### FunctionDef INPUT_TYPES(s)
**INPUT_TYPES**: The function of INPUT_TYPES is to define the required input types for a specific conditioning operation.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· conditioning_to: This parameter accepts a tuple containing the type "CONDITIONING", which indicates the target conditioning type for the operation.
· conditioning_from: This parameter also accepts a tuple containing the type "CONDITIONING", which indicates the source conditioning type for the operation.
· conditioning_to_strength: This parameter accepts a tuple containing the type "FLOAT" along with a dictionary that specifies default, minimum, maximum values, and the step increment for the float value.

**Code Description**: The INPUT_TYPES function returns a dictionary that specifies the required input types for a conditioning operation. The dictionary has a single key "required" which maps to another dictionary containing three keys: "conditioning_to", "conditioning_from", and "conditioning_to_strength". 

- The "conditioning_to" and "conditioning_from" keys are both associated with the type "CONDITIONING", indicating that these inputs must be of the conditioning type. 
- The "conditioning_to_strength" key is associated with the type "FLOAT" and includes a dictionary that defines the properties of this float input. The properties include a default value of 1.0, a minimum value of 0.0, a maximum value of 1.0, and a step increment of 0.01. This means that the strength of the conditioning can be adjusted within the specified range, allowing for fine-tuning of the conditioning effect.

**Note**: When using this function, it is important to ensure that the inputs provided conform to the specified types and constraints. This ensures that the conditioning operation functions correctly and as intended.

**Output Example**: 
{
    "required": {
        "conditioning_to": ("CONDITIONING", ),
        "conditioning_from": ("CONDITIONING", ),
        "conditioning_to_strength": ("FLOAT", {"default": 1.0, "min": 0.0, "max": 1.0, "step": 0.01})
    }
}
***
### FunctionDef addWeighted(self, conditioning_to, conditioning_from, conditioning_to_strength)
**addWeighted**: The function of addWeighted is to compute a weighted average of two sets of conditioning data, allowing for the adjustment of the output based on a specified strength parameter.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· conditioning_to: A list of tuples, where each tuple contains a tensor and a dictionary. The tensor represents the conditioning data to which the weighted average will be applied.
· conditioning_from: A list of tuples, where each tuple contains a tensor and a dictionary. The tensor represents the conditioning data that will be used to influence the output.
· conditioning_to_strength: A float value that determines the weight of the conditioning_to data in the final output.

**Code Description**: The addWeighted function begins by initializing an empty list named 'out' to store the results. It checks if the conditioning_from list contains more than one element and issues a warning if so, indicating that only the first element will be used. The function then extracts the first conditioning tensor (cond_from) and its associated pooled output (pooled_output_from) from the conditioning_from list.

The function iterates over each element in the conditioning_to list. For each element, it retrieves the conditioning tensor (t1) and its corresponding pooled output (pooled_output_to). It also slices the cond_from tensor to match the width of t1. If cond_from is narrower than t1, it concatenates zeros to cond_from to ensure they have the same width.

Next, the function computes the weighted average (tw) of t1 and cond_from using the conditioning_to_strength parameter. It creates a copy of the conditioning_to element's dictionary (t_to) and updates its pooled_output key if both pooled_output_from and pooled_output_to are available. If only pooled_output_from is available, it assigns that value to t_to.

Finally, the function appends the computed weighted tensor (tw) and the updated dictionary (t_to) as a list to the output list (out). After processing all elements, the function returns the output list wrapped in a tuple.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the conditioning_from list contains only one element, as the function is designed to use only the first element for conditioning. Additionally, the conditioning_to_strength parameter should be a float between 0 and 1 to ensure proper weighting.

**Output Example**: An example of the return value could be:
[
    [tensor([[0.5, 0.5], [0.5, 0.5]]), {"pooled_output": tensor([[0.6, 0.4]])}],
    [tensor([[0.7, 0.3], [0.7, 0.3]]), {"pooled_output": tensor([[0.8, 0.2]])}]

It defines a class method INPUT_TYPES that specifies the required inputs for the concatenation process. The inputs are two conditioning tensors, referred to as "conditioning_to" and "conditioning_from". The RETURN_TYPES attribute indicates that the output of the class will also be a conditioning tensor. The FUNCTION attribute simply names the operation that this class performs, which is "concat". The CATEGORY attribute classifies this operation under the "conditioning" category.

The core functionality of the class is implemented in the concat method. This method takes two parameters: conditioning_to and conditioning_from. It initializes an empty list called out to store the results of the concatenation. If the conditioning_from input contains more than one conditioning tensor, a warning is printed to inform the user that only the first conditioning tensor will be applied. The method then extracts the first conditioning tensor from conditioning_from.

For each conditioning tensor in conditioning_to, the method concatenates the tensor with the first conditioning tensor from conditioning_from along the specified dimension (dimension 1). The concatenated result is paired with a copy of the second element of the conditioning_to tensor (which is assumed to be some metadata or additional information) and added to the output list. Finally, the method returns a tuple containing the output list.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the conditioning_from input does not contain more than one conditioning tensor, as only the first one will be utilized in the concatenation process. Users should be aware of the dimensionality of the tensors being concatenated to avoid runtime errors.

**Output Example**: An example of the output from the concat method could look like this:  
```python
[
    (tensor([[...], [...]]), metadata_1),
    (tensor([[...], [...]]), metadata_2),
    ...
]
```  
In this example, each entry in the output list consists of a concatenated tensor and its associated metadata.

**Code Description**: The INPUT_TYPES function returns a dictionary that specifies the required input types for a conditioning operation. The dictionary contains a single key, "required", which maps to another dictionary. This inner dictionary defines two keys: "conditioning_to" and "conditioning_from", both of which are associated with a tuple containing the string "CONDITIONING". This indicates that both inputs must be of the type "CONDITIONING". The structure of the return value ensures that any implementation utilizing this function will expect these specific conditioning types as inputs.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the inputs provided to any function or method that utilizes INPUT_TYPES conform to the specified types. Failure to do so may result in errors or unexpected behavior during execution.

**Output Example**: A possible appearance of the code's return value would be:
{
    "required": {
        "conditioning_to": ("CONDITIONING",),
        "conditioning_from": ("CONDITIONING",)
    }

### FunctionDef concat(self, conditioning_to, conditioning_from)
**concat**: The function of concat is to concatenate a specified conditioning tensor from one input list to each tensor in another input list.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· parameter1: conditioning_to - A list of tuples, where each tuple contains a tensor and its associated metadata.
· parameter2: conditioning_from - A list of tuples, where each tuple contains a tensor that will be concatenated to the tensors in conditioning_to.

**Code Description**: The concat function takes two lists of conditioning tensors as input. It first checks if the conditioning_from list contains more than one tensor. If it does, a warning is printed indicating that only the first tensor will be used for concatenation. The function then extracts the first tensor from the conditioning_from list. 

For each tensor in the conditioning_to list, the function performs the following operations:
1. It retrieves the first tensor from the current tuple in conditioning_to.
2. It concatenates this tensor with the extracted tensor from conditioning_from along the second dimension (dimension index 1) using the PyTorch `torch.cat` function.
3. It creates a new tuple consisting of the concatenated tensor and a copy of the associated metadata from the current tuple in conditioning_to.
4. This new tuple is appended to the output list.

Finally, the function returns a tuple containing the output list.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the tensors being concatenated are compatible in terms of their dimensions, except for the dimension along which they are being concatenated. The warning about multiple tensors in conditioning_from serves to inform the user that only the first tensor will be utilized, which may affect the intended functionality if multiple tensors were expected to be used.

**Output Example**: If conditioning_to is [(tensor1, metadata1), (tensor2, metadata2)] and conditioning_from is [(tensor3, metadata3)], the output might look like:
([(concatenated_tensor1, metadata1), (concatenated_tensor2, metadata2)],)

- y: An integer parameter that defines the y-coordinate of the area, with a default of 0 and constraints.
- strength: A float parameter that indicates the strength of the conditioning, with a default of 1.0 and constraints on its range.

The append method processes the conditioning data by iterating over each entry in the conditioning parameter. For each entry, it creates a new list that includes the original conditioning data and modifies it by adding an 'area' key, which is calculated based on the provided width, height, x, and y values. The area dimensions are divided by 8 to normalize them. Additionally, it sets the 'strength' key to the provided strength value and sets 'set_area_to_bounds' to False. The modified conditioning data is then collected into a list, which is returned as a tuple.

**Note**: When using this class, ensure that the input parameters adhere to the specified constraints to avoid errors. The conditioning data must be structured correctly to ensure proper processing by the append method.

**Output Example**: A possible return value from the append method could look like this:
([
    ['condition1', {'area': (8, 8, 0, 0), 'strength': 1.0, 'set_area_to_bounds': False}],

Specifically, the area is defined as a tuple containing the height divided by 8, the width divided by 8, the y coordinate divided by 8, and the x coordinate divided by 8. Additionally, the strength parameter is included in the dictionary, and a flag 'set_area_to_bounds' is set to False. The function ultimately returns a tuple containing the newly constructed list.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the conditioning parameter is structured correctly as a list of tuples, and that the width, height, x, y, and strength parameters are provided as integers to avoid type errors during execution.

**Output Example**: An example of the return value when calling append with a conditioning list of [(1, {}), (2, {})], width of 160, height of 120, x of 32, y of 64, and strength of 5 would be:
(

### FunctionDef append(self, conditioning, width, height, x, y, strength)
**append**: The function of append is to create a modified list of conditioning parameters with specified area and strength attributes.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· parameter1: conditioning - A list of tuples, where each tuple contains conditioning data.
· parameter2: width - An integer representing the width of the area.
· parameter3: height - An integer representing the height of the area.
· parameter4: x - An integer representing the x-coordinate for the area.
· parameter5: y - An integer representing the y-coordinate for the area.
· parameter6: strength - A value that indicates the strength associated with the conditioning.

**Code Description**: The append function takes in a list of conditioning tuples and additional parameters that define an area in terms of its dimensions and position. It initializes an empty list `c` to store the modified conditioning data. For each tuple `t` in the conditioning list, it creates a new list `n` where the first element is the same as `t[0]`, and the second element is a copy of `t[1]`. The second element, which is expected to be a dictionary, is then updated with three key-value pairs: 
1. 'area' is set to a tuple containing the string "percentage", the height, width, y, and x values.
2. 'strength' is assigned the value of the strength parameter.
3. 'set_area_to_bounds' is explicitly set to False.

After processing all conditioning tuples, the function returns a tuple containing the modified list `c`.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the conditioning parameter is a list of tuples where the second element is a dictionary. The function assumes that the dictionary can be copied and modified without issues. The values for width, height, x, and y should be provided as integers, and the strength should be of a compatible type that can be assigned to the dictionary.

**Output Example**: An example of the return value when calling append with a conditioning list of [(1, {'key': 'value'})], width=10, height=20, x=5, y=5, and strength=0.8 would look like:
(
    [
        [1, {'key': 'value', 'area': ('percentage', 20, 10, 5, 5), 'strength': 0.8, 'set_area_to_bounds': False}]
    ],

- strength: A floating-point value that determines the strength of the mask application, with a default of 1.0, a minimum of 0.0, a maximum of 10.0, and a step of 0.01.
- set_cond_area: A selection between "default" and "mask bounds" that indicates how the conditioning area should be set.

The class method append takes these inputs and processes them as follows:
1. It initializes an empty list `c` to store the modified conditioning data.
2. It checks if the `set_cond_area` is not set to "default", in which case it sets a flag `set_area_to_bounds` to True.
3. If the mask has fewer than three dimensions, it adds a new dimension to the mask using `unsqueeze(0)`.
4. It iterates over each item in the conditioning data, creating a new entry that includes the original conditioning data along with a copy of the mask, the area setting, and the mask strength.
5. Finally, it returns a tuple containing the modified conditioning data list.

**Note**: When using this class, ensure that the mask is appropriately shaped to match the conditioning data. The strength parameter should be within the defined range to avoid unexpected behavior.

**Output Example**: A possible appearance of the code's return value could be:
```
([
    [original_conditioning_1, {'mask': mask_tensor, 'set_area_to_bounds': True, 'mask_strength': 1.0}],

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· s: This parameter is not utilized within the function and serves as a placeholder for potential future use or for maintaining a consistent function signature.

**Code Description**: The INPUT_TYPES function constructs a dictionary that specifies the required input types for a conditioning set mask. The returned dictionary contains a single key, "required", which maps to another dictionary detailing the specific inputs needed. 

The "conditioning" input is expected to be of type "CONDITIONING", indicating that it should conform to a predefined conditioning type. The "mask" input is designated as "MASK", which suggests it should be a specific type related to masking operations.

The "strength" input is defined as a floating-point number ("FLOAT") with additional constraints: a default value of 1.0, a minimum value of 0.0, a maximum value of 10.0, and a step increment of 0.01. This allows for precise control over the strength parameter, ensuring it remains within the specified range.

Lastly, the "set_cond_area" input is an array that can take one of two string values: "default" or "mask bounds". This flexibility allows the user to specify how the conditioning area is set, either to a default configuration or based on the bounds of the mask.

Overall, this function is crucial for establishing the input requirements for a conditioning set mask, ensuring that users provide the necessary parameters in the correct format.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the inputs provided conform to the specified types and constraints to avoid errors during processing.

**Output Example**: A possible return value of the INPUT_TYPES function could look like this:
{
    "required": {
        "conditioning": ("CONDITIONING", ),
        "mask": ("MASK", ),
        "strength": ("FLOAT", {"default": 1.0, "min": 0.0, "max": 10.0, "step": 0.01}),

### FunctionDef append(self, conditioning, mask, set_cond_area, strength)
**append**: The function of append is to add conditioning information along with a mask and its associated parameters to a collection.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· parameter1: conditioning - A list of tuples where each tuple contains conditioning information.
· parameter2: mask - A tensor representing the mask to be applied, which may have multiple dimensions.
· parameter3: set_cond_area - A string that determines whether to set the area to bounds or not.
· parameter4: strength - A value representing the strength of the mask.

**Code Description**: The append function processes the provided conditioning data and associates it with a mask and additional parameters. It begins by initializing an empty list `c` to store the results. The variable `set_area_to_bounds` is set to False by default. If the `set_cond_area` parameter is not equal to "default", it is updated to True, indicating that the area should be constrained to bounds.

Next, the function checks the shape of the `mask`. If the mask has fewer than three dimensions, it is expanded by adding a new dimension at the front using the `unsqueeze(0)` method. This ensures that the mask has the appropriate shape for further processing.

The function then iterates over each element in the `conditioning` list. For each element, it creates a new list `n` that contains the first element of the tuple and a copy of the second element (which is expected to be a dictionary). The mask is then assigned to the key 'mask' in this dictionary, and the values for 'set_area_to_bounds' and 'mask_strength' are also added. Each modified tuple is appended to the list `c`.

Finally, the function returns a tuple containing the list `c`, which now holds all the conditioning data along with the associated mask and parameters.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the `mask` parameter is in the correct shape before calling this function. Additionally, the `conditioning` list should be properly structured as tuples to avoid errors during processing.

**Output Example**: An example of the return value of the function could look like this:
```
([
    [condition1, {'mask': mask_tensor, 'set_area_to_bounds': True, 'mask_strength': 0.8}],
    [condition2, {'mask': mask_tensor, 'set_area_to_bounds': False, 'mask_strength': 0.5}]

· INPUT_TYPES: A class method that defines the input types required by the function. It specifies that the input must include a "conditioning" parameter of type "CONDITIONING".  
· RETURN_TYPES: A tuple indicating the return type of the function, which is "CONDITIONING".  
· FUNCTION: A string that names the function to be executed, which is "zero_out".  
· CATEGORY: A string that categorizes this class under "advanced/conditioning".

**Code Description**: The ConditioningZeroOut class is designed to process conditioning data by zeroing out the "pooled_output" tensor within each conditioning element. The class includes a class method INPUT_TYPES that specifies the required input format, which is a dictionary containing a "conditioning" key. The RETURN_TYPES attribute indicates that the output will also be of type "CONDITIONING". The core functionality is implemented in the zero_out method, which takes a list of conditioning tuples as input. Each tuple consists of a tensor and a dictionary. The method iterates through the conditioning list, and for each tuple, it checks if the dictionary contains a key named "pooled_output". If this key exists, the corresponding tensor is replaced with a tensor of zeros that has the same shape as the original. The method then constructs a new list of modified conditioning tuples, where the first element is a zero tensor and the second element is the modified dictionary. Finally, the method returns a tuple containing the new conditioning list.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the input conditioning data is structured correctly, as the method relies on the presence of specific keys in the input dictionaries. Additionally, the use of PyTorch is implied, as the method utilizes torch functions to create zero tensors.

**Output Example**: An example of the output from the zero_out method could look like this:
```python
[
    (tensor([[0., 0., 0.], [0., 0., 0.]]), {"pooled_output": tensor([[0., 0., 0.]])}),
    (tensor([[0., 0., 0.], [0., 0., 0.]]), {"pooled_output": tensor([[0., 0., 0.]])}),
]
``` 
This output indicates that each original conditioning tuple has been transformed, with the "pooled_output" tensor replaced by a tensor of zeros.
### FunctionDef INPUT_TYPES(s)
**INPUT_TYPES**: The function of INPUT_TYPES is to define the required input types for a specific conditioning operation.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· parameter1: s - This parameter is a placeholder and is not utilized within the function body.

**Code Description**: The INPUT_TYPES function returns a dictionary that specifies the required input types for a conditioning operation. The returned dictionary contains a single key, "required", which maps to another dictionary. This inner dictionary has one key, "conditioning", which is associated with a tuple containing a single string, "CONDITIONING". This structure indicates that the function expects an input of type "CONDITIONING" to be provided as a requirement for the operation.

The purpose of this function is to standardize the input requirements for components that utilize conditioning, ensuring that any implementation that calls this function will have a clear understanding of what inputs are necessary for proper functionality. This is particularly useful in scenarios where multiple conditioning types may exist, allowing for easy extensibility and maintenance of the code.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that any implementation utilizing this function adheres to the specified input types to avoid errors during execution. The function does not perform any validation or error handling; it simply defines the expected structure.

{
    "required": {
        "conditioning": ("CONDITIONING", )
    }

**zero_out**: The function of zero_out is to modify the input conditioning by zeroing out the "pooled_output" tensor and returning a modified list of tensors.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· conditioning: A list of tuples, where each tuple contains a tensor and a dictionary. The dictionary may include a key "pooled_output" which is a tensor that will be zeroed out.

**Code Description**: The zero_out function processes the input parameter 'conditioning', which is expected to be a list of tuples. Each tuple consists of a tensor and a dictionary. The function initializes an empty list 'c' to store the modified output. It then iterates over each tuple in the conditioning list. For each tuple, it creates a copy of the dictionary (denoted as 'd'). If the key "pooled_output" exists in this dictionary, the corresponding tensor is replaced with a tensor of zeros that has the same shape as the original "pooled_output" tensor. The function then constructs a new list 'n' that contains a tensor of zeros with the same shape as the first element of the tuple and the modified dictionary 'd'. This new list 'n' is appended to the list 'c'. After processing all tuples, the function returns a tuple containing the list 'c'.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the input conditioning is structured correctly, with each element being a tuple containing a tensor and a dictionary. The function specifically looks for the "pooled_output" key in the dictionary; if it is absent, the dictionary remains unchanged.

**Output Example**: If the input conditioning is as follows:
[
    (torch.tensor([[1, 2], [3, 4]]), {"pooled_output": torch.tensor([[5, 6], [7, 8]])}),
    (torch.tensor([[9, 10], [11, 12]]), {"other_key": torch.tensor([[13, 14]])})
]
The output of the zero_out function would be:
(
    [
        (torch.zeros_like(torch.tensor([[1, 2], [3, 4]])), {"pooled_output": torch.zeros_like(torch.tensor([[5, 6], [7, 8]]))}),

The inputs include a conditioning dataset and two floating-point values, start and end, which represent the percentage range. The start and end values are constrained to be between 0.0 and 1.0, with a default value of 0.0 for start and 1.0 for end. The class also defines RETURN_TYPES, which indicates that the output will be of type "CONDITIONING". The FUNCTION attribute specifies that the method to be called is "set_range".

The core functionality is implemented in the set_range method, which takes three parameters: conditioning, start, and end. The method iterates over the conditioning data, copying each element and modifying its dictionary to include the new start and end percentage values. The modified elements are then collected into a new list, which is returned as a single-element tuple.

**Note**: When using this class, ensure that the start and end values are within the specified range (0.0 to 1.0) to avoid unexpected behavior. The conditioning input should be structured correctly to match the expected format for successful execution.

**Output Example**: An example of the output from the set_range method might look like this:
```
[
    ["condition_1", {"start_percent": 0.2, "end_percent": 0.8}],
    ["condition_2", {"start_percent": 0.2, "end_percent": 0.8}],

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· s: This parameter is typically used as a placeholder and does not affect the output of the function.

**Code Description**: The INPUT_TYPES function constructs and returns a dictionary that specifies the required input types for a conditioning set. The dictionary contains a single key, "required", which maps to another dictionary detailing three specific inputs: "conditioning", "start", and "end". 

- The "conditioning" key is associated with a tuple containing a string "CONDITIONING", indicating that this input is expected to be of a specific conditioning type.
- The "start" key is associated with a tuple that defines a floating-point number input. This input has a default value of 0.0 and is constrained to a minimum value of 0.0 and a maximum value of 1.0, with a step increment of 0.001. This means that the user can specify a starting point for the conditioning set within the defined range.
- The "end" key is similarly defined as a floating-point number input, with a default value of 1.0, a minimum of 0.0, and a maximum of 1.0, also allowing for a step increment of 0.001. This input specifies the endpoint for the conditioning set.

The structure of the returned dictionary ensures that users provide the necessary inputs in a controlled manner, adhering to the specified types and constraints.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the values provided for "start" and "end" fall within the defined range to avoid errors during execution. Additionally, the "conditioning" input must be correctly specified to match the expected conditioning type.

**Output Example**: A possible appearance of the code's return value could be:
{

· parameter2: start - A float value representing the starting percentage to be set in the conditioning data.
· parameter3: end - A float value representing the ending percentage to be set in the conditioning data.

**Code Description**: The set_range function takes three parameters: conditioning, start, and end. It initializes an empty list `c` to store the modified conditioning data. The function iterates over each element `t` in the conditioning list. For each element, it creates a copy of the second item in the tuple (which is expected to be a dictionary) and assigns the provided start and end values to the keys 'start_percent' and 'end_percent', respectively. A new tuple is then created, consisting of the original identifier (the first item in the tuple) and the modified dictionary. This new tuple is appended to the list `c`. After processing all elements, the function returns a tuple containing the modified list `c`.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the conditioning parameter is structured as a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a valid identifier and a dictionary. The start and end parameters should be numeric values that represent valid percentage ranges.

**Output Example**: If the input conditioning is `[('id1', {'some_key': 'some_value'}), ('id2', {'some_key': 'some_value'})]`, with start set to 0.1 and end set to 0.9, the output of the function would be:

· vae: An instance of a Variational Autoencoder used for decoding the samples.
· samples: A dictionary containing the latent samples to be decoded, specifically under the key "samples".

**Code Description**: The decode function takes two parameters: a VAE instance and a dictionary of samples. It calls the decode method of the VAE instance, passing the "samples" from the provided dictionary. The function returns a tuple containing the decoded output. This function is designed to facilitate the decoding process of latent representations generated by the VAE, transforming them back into a more interpretable format, such as images or other data types depending on the application of the VAE.

The decode function is called within the decode_vae function located in the modules/core.py file. In decode_vae, the function checks if the tiled parameter is set to True. If it is, it utilizes a different decoding method (opVAEDecodeTiled.decode) that processes the latent image in tiles. If tiled is False, it directly calls the opVAEDecode.decode function, which in turn invokes the decode method of the VAE through the decode function. This establishes a clear relationship where decode serves as a utility for the decode_vae function, enabling it to handle both tiled and non-tiled decoding scenarios.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the samples dictionary contains the key "samples" with valid latent data before calling this function to avoid potential errors.

**Output Example**: A possible appearance of the code's return value could be a tuple containing a numpy array or a tensor representing the decoded image or data, such as (array([[0.1, 0.2, ...], [0.3, 0.4, ...]]),).

· RETURN_TYPES: Defines the type of output returned by the encode function, which is a latent representation.
· FUNCTION: Indicates the name of the function used for encoding, which is "encode".
· CATEGORY: Categorizes the functionality of the class under "latent".

**Code Description**: The VAEEncode class is designed to facilitate the encoding of image data into a latent representation using a Variational Autoencoder (VAE). It provides a method to preprocess the input image by cropping it to ensure that its dimensions are multiples of 8, which is a requirement for many neural network architectures. This preprocessing is handled by the static method `vae_encode_crop_pixels`, which calculates the appropriate dimensions and offsets to crop the image accordingly.

The main method of the class, `encode`, takes two parameters: `vae`, which is an instance of a Variational Autoencoder, and `pixels`, which is the input image data. The method first calls `vae_encode_crop_pixels` to preprocess the image, ensuring it meets the dimensional requirements. It then passes the cropped image (specifically the first three channels, typically representing RGB) to the VAE's encode method, which generates the latent representation of the image. The output is structured as a dictionary containing the key "samples" that holds the latent representation.

This class is utilized by other components in the project, such as `VAEEncodeTiled`, which extends its functionality by allowing tiled encoding of images. In the `encode` method of `VAEEncodeTiled`, the same cropping function is called to ensure the input image is appropriately processed before being passed to the VAE's tiled encoding method. This demonstrates the modular design of the code, where `VAEEncode` serves as a foundational component for more complex encoding strategies.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the input image dimensions are compatible with the VAE's requirements. The cropping process is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the encoding process.

**Output Example**: A possible appearance of the code's return value could be:
```python
{"samples": <latent_representation_array>}
```
Where `<latent_representation_array>` is a NumPy array or similar structure representing the encoded latent space of the input image.
### FunctionDef INPUT_TYPES(s)
**INPUT_TYPES**: The function of INPUT_TYPES is to define the required input types for a specific operation involving images and variational autoencoders (VAEs).

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· parameter1: s - This parameter is not utilized within the function body and serves as a placeholder.

**Code Description**: The INPUT_TYPES function returns a dictionary that specifies the required input types for a particular process. The dictionary contains a single key, "required", which maps to another dictionary. This inner dictionary defines two required inputs: "pixels" and "vae". The "pixels" input is expected to be of type "IMAGE", while the "vae" input is expected to be of type "VAE". This structure is essential for ensuring that the correct types of data are provided to the function or method that calls INPUT_TYPES, facilitating proper operation and integration within a larger framework that likely involves image processing and machine learning.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the inputs provided match the specified types ("IMAGE" for pixels and "VAE" for the variational autoencoder) to avoid errors during execution.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· pixels: A 4-dimensional numpy array representing the pixel data, typically in the format (batch_size, height, width, channels).

**Code Description**: The vae_encode_crop_pixels function takes a 4-dimensional numpy array of pixel data as input. It calculates the largest dimensions that are multiples of 8 for both height and width. If the original height and width are not multiples of 8, the function computes the necessary offsets to crop the pixel array symmetrically. The cropping is performed by slicing the pixel array to retain only the central portion that fits the calculated dimensions. This ensures that the output pixel array has dimensions that are suitable for further processing, particularly in Variational Autoencoder (VAE) applications where input sizes often need to conform to specific requirements.

This function is called by two other functions in the project: the encode method in both the VAEEncode and VAEEncodeTiled classes. In the encode method of VAEEncode, the cropped pixels are passed to the VAE's encode function, which processes the first three channels of the pixel data. Similarly, in the encode method of VAEEncodeTiled, the cropped pixels are used in a tiled encoding process. This indicates that the cropping operation is a preparatory step to ensure that the pixel data conforms to the expected input dimensions for the VAE encoding processes.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the input pixel array has at least three channels, as the function slices the array to retain only the first three channels for encoding.

**Output Example**: A possible appearance of the code's return value could be a 4-dimensional numpy array with dimensions (batch_size, height, width, channels), where height and width are both multiples of 8, such as (32, 64, 64, 3).

**Code Description**: The encode function first invokes the vae_encode_crop_pixels function to crop the input pixel array, ensuring that its dimensions are multiples of 8. This is crucial for compatibility with the VAE's encoding process. The cropped pixel data is then passed to the VAE's encode method, which processes only the first three channels of the pixel data. The encode function returns a dictionary containing the encoded samples as its output.

The encode function is called by the encode_vae function located in the modules/core.py file. In this context, encode_vae serves as a higher-level function that decides whether to use tiled encoding or standard encoding based on the tiled parameter. If tiled is set to True, it calls the encode method from the VAEEncodeTiled class; otherwise, it calls the encode method from the VAEEncode class. This indicates that the encode function plays a critical role in the encoding pipeline, ensuring that pixel data is properly prepared and processed by the VAE.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the input pixel array has at least three channels, as the function slices the array to retain only the first three channels for encoding. Additionally, the input pixel array should be formatted correctly to avoid any errors during the encoding process.

**Output Example**: A possible appearance of the code's return value could be a dictionary containing the encoded samples, such as {"samples": encoded_data}, where encoded_data is the output from the VAE's encode method.

The RETURN_TYPES attribute indicates that the output of the encoding process will be a latent representation.

The core functionality of the class is encapsulated in the encode method, which takes the VAE model, the image pixels, and the tile size as parameters. Within this method, the image pixels are first processed by the VAEEncode class's vae_encode_crop_pixels method to prepare them for encoding. The method then calls the vae's encode_tiled function, passing the processed pixels and the specified tile size for both the x and y dimensions. The result of this encoding process, which is a latent representation, is returned in a dictionary format.

From a functional perspective, the VAEEncodeTiled class is likely called by other components in the project, such as the modules/core.py file. This indicates that the class is part of a larger system where image encoding is necessary, possibly for tasks such as image generation, manipulation, or analysis using VAEs.

### FunctionDef encode(self, vae, pixels, tile_size)
**encode**: The function of encode is to process image data through a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) by cropping the input pixels and generating a latent representation.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· vae: An instance of a Variational Autoencoder that will be used to encode the image data.
· pixels: A 4-dimensional numpy array representing the pixel data of the image, typically in the format (batch_size, height, width, channels).

**Code Description**: The encode function is a method within the VAEEncodeTiled class that facilitates the encoding of image data into a latent representation using a Variational Autoencoder (VAE). The function begins by calling the static method `vae_encode_crop_pixels`, which is responsible for ensuring that the input pixel array has dimensions that are multiples of 8. This preprocessing step is crucial as many neural network architectures, including VAEs, require input dimensions to conform to specific constraints.

Once the pixel data has been cropped appropriately, the function proceeds to encode the image using the VAE's `encode_tiled` method. It specifically passes the first three channels of the cropped pixel data, which typically represent the RGB color channels. The output of the encoding process is a latent representation of the input image, structured as a dictionary with the key "samples" that holds the encoded data.

The encode function is called by the `encode_vae` function located in the modules/core.py file. This function serves as a higher-level interface for encoding images using a VAE. It determines whether to use tiled encoding by checking the `tiled` parameter. If `tiled` is set to True, it invokes the `encode` method of the VAEEncodeTiled class, passing the necessary parameters. If `tiled` is False, it calls the encode method of the VAEEncode class instead. This demonstrates the modular design of the code, where the encode function is part of a larger encoding framework that allows for flexibility in processing image data.

**Note**: It is essential to ensure that the input pixel array has at least three channels, as the function only processes the first three channels for encoding. Additionally, the cropping process is critical for maintaining the integrity of the encoding operation, ensuring that the input dimensions meet the requirements of the VAE.

**Output Example**: A possible appearance of the code's return value could be:
```python
{"samples": <latent_representation_array>}

The class defines a method called encode that takes in several parameters: the VAE model, the image pixels, a mask indicating the areas to be inpainted, and an optional integer parameter grow_mask_by that determines how much to expand the mask. 

The encode method begins by adjusting the dimensions of the input image pixels and the mask to ensure they are compatible for processing. It resizes the mask to match the dimensions of the input pixels using bilinear interpolation. If the dimensions of the input pixels are not multiples of 8, the method crops the pixels and mask to the nearest valid size.

To enhance the inpainting process, the method can grow the mask by a specified number of pixels using a convolution operation with a kernel tensor. This operation helps to create a seamless transition in the latent space by slightly expanding the areas marked for inpainting.

The method then normalizes the pixel values by centering them around 0.5, applying the mask to ensure that only the non-masked areas are considered during encoding. Finally, the method calls the encode function of the VAE model to obtain the latent representation of the processed pixels and returns this representation along with the modified mask.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the input images and masks are properly formatted and that the grow_mask_by parameter is set according to the desired level of mask expansion. The output will contain both the latent samples and the modified noise mask.

**Output Example**: A possible appearance of the code's return value could be:

### FunctionDef encode(self, vae, pixels, mask, grow_mask_by)
**encode**: The function of encode is to process input pixel data and a mask through a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) for inpainting tasks.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· vae: An instance of a Variational Autoencoder used for encoding the pixel data.
· pixels: A tensor containing the pixel data to be encoded, typically in the shape of (batch_size, height, width, channels).
· mask: A tensor representing the mask that indicates which pixels are to be inpainted, with the same spatial dimensions as pixels.
· grow_mask_by: An integer that specifies how much to expand the mask to ensure seamless blending in the latent space (default is 6).

**Code Description**: The encode function begins by determining the dimensions of the input pixel tensor, ensuring they are multiples of 8 for compatibility with the VAE. It reshapes and interpolates the mask tensor to match the pixel dimensions. If the pixel dimensions are not aligned to multiples of 8, the function crops the pixel and mask tensors accordingly.

Next, the function optionally expands the mask using a convolution operation with a kernel of ones, which effectively grows the mask by the specified number of pixels (grow_mask_by). This step is crucial for maintaining seamless transitions in the latent space during inpainting.

The function then prepares the pixel data by adjusting its values based on the mask. It subtracts 0.5 from each color channel of the pixel tensor, multiplies by the inverted mask, and adds 0.5 back. This normalization step ensures that the pixel values are centered around 0.5 where the mask is applied.

Finally, the processed pixel data is passed to the VAE's encode method, and the function returns a dictionary containing the encoded samples and the modified mask.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the input pixel data and mask are correctly shaped and normalized before calling this function. The grow_mask_by parameter should be set according to the desired level of mask expansion for optimal results.

**Output Example**: An example of the return value from the encode function could look like this:
{
  "samples": tensor([[...]]),  # Encoded latent representation from the VAE
  "noise_mask": tensor([[...]])  # Mask indicating which pixels were processed

**Code Description**: The InpaintModelConditioning class is designed to facilitate the encoding of conditioning data used in image inpainting. It provides a structured way to handle inputs and outputs necessary for this process. The class defines a class method INPUT_TYPES that specifies the required inputs: positive conditioning, negative conditioning, a variational autoencoder (VAE), image pixels, and a mask. The encode method processes these inputs to produce encoded conditioning data.

The encode method begins by adjusting the dimensions of the input pixels and mask to ensure they are compatible for processing. It calculates the nearest dimensions that are multiples of 8 and crops the input images accordingly. The mask is resized to match the pixel dimensions using bilinear interpolation.

Next, the method prepares the pixel data by normalizing it based on the mask. It subtracts 0.5 from each color channel of the pixels, applies the mask, and then re-adds 0.5 to the modified pixel values. This step ensures that the pixels are adjusted according to the masked areas, which is crucial for inpainting tasks.

The method then encodes the adjusted pixels using the provided VAE and also encodes the original pixels to obtain a latent representation. The output is structured into a dictionary that contains the original latent representation and the noise mask.

Finally, the method constructs the output conditioning data by iterating over the positive and negative conditioning inputs, appending the concatenated latent image and mask to each conditioning entry. The method returns a tuple containing the processed positive conditioning, negative conditioning, and the latent representation.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the input images and masks are properly formatted and of compatible sizes before invoking the encode method. The method assumes that the VAE is correctly initialized and can handle the provided pixel data.

### FunctionDef encode(self, positive, negative, pixels, vae, mask)
**encode**: The function of encode is to process input pixel data along with conditioning information to generate latent representations for image inpainting.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· parameter1: positive - A list of positive conditioning data used for guiding the encoding process.  
· parameter2: negative - A list of negative conditioning data that helps in refining the encoding.  
· parameter3: pixels - A tensor representing the pixel data of the image to be encoded.  
· parameter4: vae - An instance of a Variational Autoencoder used for encoding the pixel data.  
· parameter5: mask - A tensor indicating the areas of the image that are to be masked or inpainted.

**Code Description**: The encode function begins by determining the dimensions of the input pixel tensor, ensuring that they are multiples of 8. It adjusts the mask tensor to match the size of the pixel tensor using bilinear interpolation. The function then creates a clone of the original pixel data for later use. If the dimensions of the pixel tensor are not aligned with the nearest lower multiples of 8, it crops the pixel tensor and the mask accordingly.

Next, the function prepares the pixel data for encoding by normalizing the pixel values and applying the mask. The normalization process involves centering the pixel values around 0.5 and scaling them based on the mask, which effectively zeroes out the masked areas. 

The function then encodes both the masked pixel data and the original pixel data using the provided Variational Autoencoder (VAE). The results of these encodings are stored in a dictionary called out_latent, which includes the original latent representation and the noise mask.

Finally, the function constructs the output by iterating over the positive and negative conditioning lists, appending the concatenated latent image and mask to each conditioning entry. The function returns a tuple containing the processed positive conditioning, negative conditioning, and the out_latent dictionary.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the input pixel tensor and mask are correctly shaped and that the VAE is properly initialized before calling this function. The function assumes that the pixel data is in a format compatible with the VAE's encoding method.

**Output Example**: A possible appearance of the code's return value could be:
(
    [[(positive_conditioning_1, {'concat_latent_image': latent_image_1, 'concat_mask': mask_1}), ...]],
    [[(negative_conditioning_1, {'concat_latent_image': latent_image_2, 'concat_mask': mask_2}), ...]],

**Code Description**: The load function begins by calling the get_annotated_filepath function from the ldm_patched.utils.path_utils module, passing the latent parameter to obtain the full file path of the latent data. This function constructs the path based on the provided name and any associated annotations that may indicate the type of file.

Once the file path is retrieved, the function utilizes the safetensors.torch.load_file method to load the latent data from the specified path into memory, specifically targeting the CPU for processing. The loaded data is expected to be in a dictionary format, which includes a key named "latent_tensor" that contains the actual tensor data.

The function then checks for the presence of the key "latent_format_version_0" in the loaded latent data. If this key is not found, it sets a multiplier to adjust the tensor values, specifically dividing by 0.18215. This adjustment ensures that the tensor values are scaled appropriately based on the format version of the latent data.

Finally, the function constructs a dictionary named samples, which contains the key "samples" associated with the processed latent tensor, converted to a float type and multiplied by the determined multiplier. The function returns a tuple containing this samples dictionary, providing a structured output that can be utilized by other components of the application.

The load function is integral to the LoadLatent class, facilitating the retrieval and processing of latent data necessary for further operations within the project. It relies on the get_annotated_filepath function to ensure that the correct file path is accessed, thereby maintaining consistency and accuracy in file handling across the application.

· s: A string that represents a state or identifier, though it is not utilized within the function's logic.
· latent: A variable that is expected to provide the necessary information to retrieve the file path.

**Code Description**: The IS_CHANGED function begins by calling the `get_annotated_filepath` function from the `ldm_patched.utils.path_utils` module, passing the `latent` parameter to obtain the full file path of the image associated with the latent representation. This path is stored in the variable `image_path`. 

Next, the function initializes a SHA-256 hash object using the `hashlib` library. It then opens the file located at `image_path` in binary read mode ('rb'). The contents of the file are read and fed into the hash object using the `update` method, which processes the data to compute the hash. Once all data has been read and processed, the function calls the `digest` method to retrieve the binary hash value, which is then converted to a hexadecimal string using the `hex` method.

The IS_CHANGED function is primarily used to determine if the contents of the file have changed by comparing the computed hash with a previously stored hash value. If the hash differs, it indicates that the file has been modified.

This function is crucial in scenarios where file integrity needs to be verified, such as in loading and processing latent representations in machine learning workflows. It ensures that the correct and unaltered files are being used in subsequent operations.

· latent: A string representing the path to the latent file that needs to be validated.

**Code Description**: The VALIDATE_INPUTS function begins by calling the exists_annotated_filepath function from the ldm_patched.utils.path_utils module, passing the latent parameter as an argument. This function checks if a file with the specified name exists in the appropriate directory, which may be determined based on annotations in the file name. If the file does not exist, exists_annotated_filepath returns False, and the VALIDATE_INPUTS function constructs an error message indicating that the provided latent file is invalid. This message is formatted to include the name of the latent file that was checked. If the file exists, the function returns True, indicating that the input is valid.

The relationship between VALIDATE_INPUTS and exists_annotated_filepath is crucial, as VALIDATE_INPUTS relies on the latter to perform the actual file existence check. This design ensures that the validation process is centralized and consistent across different parts of the application that may require file validation.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the latent parameter passed to VALIDATE_INPUTS is a valid string representing a file path. Additionally, the function does not handle exceptions that may arise from the exists_annotated_filepath function, so any issues related to file system access should be managed externally.

· ckpt_name: A string representing the name of the checkpoint file to be loaded.
· output_vae: A boolean flag indicating whether to include the Variational Autoencoder (VAE) component in the output (default is True).
· output_clip: A boolean flag indicating whether to include the CLIP component in the output (default is True).

**Code Description**: The load_checkpoint function is designed to facilitate the loading of model components from a checkpoint file. It begins by constructing the full path to the checkpoint file using the get_full_path function, which ensures that the correct file path is retrieved based on the provided checkpoint name. This function relies on the folder structure defined in the project to locate the checkpoints.

Once the full path to the checkpoint is obtained, the function calls load_checkpoint_guess_config, passing the checkpoint path along with the flags for outputting the VAE and CLIP components. The load_checkpoint_guess_config function is responsible for loading the model components from the checkpoint file, managing device configurations, and returning the relevant model instances.

The load_checkpoint function specifically returns the first three elements of the output from load_checkpoint_guess_config, which typically include the main model, the CLIP model, and the VAE model, depending on the flags set during the call. This function is integral to the checkpoint loading process within various loader classes in the project, ensuring that the necessary components are correctly initialized for further operations.

**Note**: It is essential to ensure that the checkpoint name provided to the function corresponds to an existing file within the designated checkpoints folder. If the checkpoint file does not exist, the loading process will fail, and appropriate error handling should be implemented in the calling context.

**Output Example**: A possible appearance of the code's return value could be a tuple containing the loaded model components:
```python
(model_instance, clip_model_instance, vae_model_instance)
```

· RETURN_TYPES: A tuple indicating the types of outputs returned by the loader, which are "MODEL", "CLIP", and "VAE".
· FUNCTION: A string that specifies the function name to be called for loading the checkpoint, which is "load_checkpoint".
· CATEGORY: A string that categorizes the loader under "advanced/loaders/deprecated".

**Code Description**: The DiffusersLoader class is designed to facilitate the loading of models from the Diffusers framework. It contains a class method INPUT_TYPES that dynamically generates a list of valid model paths by searching through directories named "diffusers". This method checks for the existence of a file named "model_index.json" within these directories to confirm they contain valid model data. The method returns a dictionary specifying the required input, which is the model path.

The class also defines a method named load_checkpoint, which takes in parameters for the model path and optional boolean flags for outputting the Variational Autoencoder (VAE) and Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) components. The method searches for the specified model path within the previously identified directories. If the model path exists, it proceeds to load the model using the ldm_patched.modules.diffusers_load.load_diffusers function, passing along the necessary parameters including the output flags and the paths for embeddings.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the directories being searched contain the necessary files for the loader to function correctly. The loader is categorized as deprecated, indicating that it may be subject to removal or replacement in future versions.

**Output Example**: A possible return value from the load_checkpoint method could be a tuple containing the loaded model, the CLIP model, and the VAE model, structured as follows:
(model_instance, clip_instance, vae_instance)
### FunctionDef INPUT_TYPES(cls)
**INPUT_TYPES**: The function of INPUT_TYPES is to retrieve the required input types for model paths associated with the "diffusers" folder.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· cls: This parameter represents the class itself and is used to define class methods.

**Code Description**: The INPUT_TYPES function is designed to gather and return a structured dictionary containing the paths to model directories that include a specific file, "model_index.json". It begins by initializing an empty list named `paths`. The function then calls `ldm_patched.utils.path_utils.get_folder_paths` with the argument "diffusers" to obtain a list of folder paths associated with that name. For each path returned, it checks if the path exists on the filesystem. If the path exists, it traverses the directory structure using `os.walk`, which allows it to explore all subdirectories and files within the specified search path. During this traversal, it specifically looks for the presence of the "model_index.json" file within the files of each directory. If this file is found, the relative path of the directory (with respect to the search path) is appended to the `paths` list.

Finally, the function returns a dictionary with a single key "required", which maps to another dictionary containing "model_path" as a key. The value associated with "model_path" is a tuple containing the list of paths that were collected. This structured output is essential for other components in the project that require specific model paths for loading operations.

The INPUT_TYPES function is closely related to the `get_folder_paths` function, which it utilizes to obtain the initial folder paths. The successful execution of INPUT_TYPES relies on the correct functioning of `get_folder_paths`, as it provides the necessary paths to search for the "model_index.json" file.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the "diffusers" folder exists and is correctly set up in the project's directory structure. If the folder does not exist or does not contain the expected files, the resulting paths list may be empty, which could lead to issues when attempting to load models.

**Output Example**: A possible appearance of the code's return value could be:
{"required": {"model_path": (["relative/path/to/model1", "relative/path/to/model2"], )}}
***

**load_checkpoint**: The function of load_checkpoint is to locate and load a model checkpoint from a specified path, ensuring that the necessary components for a diffusion model are available.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· model_path: A string representing the relative path to the model checkpoint that needs to be loaded.
· output_vae: A boolean indicating whether to load the Variational Autoencoder (VAE) model (default is True).
· output_clip: A boolean indicating whether to load the CLIP model (default is True).

**Code Description**: The load_checkpoint function is responsible for finding the correct model path and loading the associated components of a diffusion model. It begins by searching for the specified model_path within a set of predefined folder paths related to "diffusers." This is achieved by calling the get_folder_paths function from the ldm_patched.utils.path_utils module, which retrieves a list of folder paths associated with the "diffusers" directory. The function checks each folder path to see if the model_path exists. If it finds a valid path, it updates the model_path variable to this new location.

Once the correct model path is determined, the function proceeds to load the model components by invoking the load_diffusers function from the ldm_patched.modules.diffusers_load module. This function is called with the resolved model_path, along with the output_vae and output_clip parameters, which dictate whether the VAE and CLIP models should be loaded. Additionally, it provides an embedding directory obtained from the get_folder_paths function for loading any necessary embeddings.

The load_checkpoint function is typically called by other components within the project that require loading model checkpoints, such as the DiffusersLoader class. This integration ensures that when a checkpoint is loaded, all necessary components of the diffusion model are correctly initialized and ready for use.

**Note**: It is essential to ensure that the model_path provided is valid and that the necessary files exist within the specified directory. If the model_path cannot be found, the function may not be able to load the required components, which could lead to errors in subsequent operations.

**Output Example**: A possible return value from load_checkpoint could be a tuple containing the loaded components of the diffusion model, structured as follows:
```
(unet_model_instance, clip_model_instance, vae_model_instance)
```

The class provides a class method INPUT_TYPES that defines the required input types for the loading process. It specifies that the method requires a model, a clip, a lora_name (which is fetched from a list of available LoRA files), and two strength parameters for the model and clip, respectively. These strength parameters allow users to control the influence of the LoRA model on the original model and clip.

The main functionality is encapsulated in the load_lora method. This method first checks if both strength parameters are zero; if so, it returns the original model and clip without any modifications. If the strengths are non-zero, it retrieves the full path of the specified LoRA file. The method then checks if the LoRA has already been loaded by comparing the current path with the cached loaded_lora. If the LoRA is not already loaded, it loads the LoRA file using a utility function and caches it.

Finally, the method applies the loaded LoRA to the provided model and clip using another utility function, returning the modified model and clip. 

The LoraLoader class is extended by the LoraLoaderModelOnly class, which simplifies the loading process by only requiring a model and a LoRA name, ignoring the clip input. It uses the load_lora method to perform the loading operation, ensuring that the model is adapted with the specified LoRA.

· lora_name: A string representing the name of the LoRA file to be loaded.  
· strength_model: A float representing the strength of the LoRA application to the model.  
· strength_clip: A float representing the strength of the LoRA application to the clip.  

**Code Description**: The load_lora function is designed to facilitate the integration of LoRA weights into both a model and a clip. It begins by checking if both strength_model and strength_clip are set to zero. If they are, the function returns the original model and clip without any modifications.

Next, the function retrieves the full path of the specified LoRA file using the get_full_path function from the ldm_patched.utils.path_utils module. If a LoRA has already been loaded and matches the requested path, it reuses the loaded LoRA to avoid redundant loading. If not, it loads the LoRA weights from the specified file using the load_torch_file function from the ldm_patched.modules.utils module, which handles the loading of PyTorch model checkpoints.

After successfully loading the LoRA weights, the function applies these weights to the model and clip using the load_lora_for_models function from the ldm_patched.modules.sd module. This function takes care of applying the LoRA weights with the specified strengths to both the model and clip, returning the modified versions.

The load_lora function is called by the load_lora_model_only method in the LoraLoaderModelOnly class. This method specifically focuses on loading LoRA weights for a model while setting the clip parameter to None and the strength_clip to zero, indicating that no modifications will be made to the clip.

**Note**: It is essential to ensure that the provided lora_name corresponds to an existing file in the expected directory. Additionally, the model and clip objects should be compatible with the expected formats for the application of LoRA weights.

**Output Example**: A possible return value from load_lora could be a tuple containing the modified model and clip, such as (modified_model, modified_clip), where modified_model is the model with applied LoRA weights and modified_clip is the clip, which may remain unchanged if no clip was provided.

This class is specifically designed for scenarios where the clip input is not necessary, making it more straightforward for users who only need to adapt a model using a LoRA.

The class method INPUT_TYPES defines the inputs required for the loading operation. It specifies that the method requires:
- model: The model to which the LoRA will be applied.
- lora_name: The name of the LoRA file, which is fetched from a list of available LoRA files using the utility function `ldm_patched.utils.path_utils.get_filename_list("loras")`.
- strength_model: A floating-point value that determines the influence of the LoRA model on the original model, with a default value of 1.0 and a range from -20.0 to 20.0.

The RETURN_TYPES attribute indicates that the output of the loading operation will be a tuple containing the modified model.

The main functionality is encapsulated in the method load_lora_model_only, which takes the model, lora_name, and strength_model as parameters. This method calls the load_lora method from the parent LoraLoader class, passing the model, None (indicating no clip), the lora_name, strength_model, and a fixed value of 0 for the clip strength. The load_lora method handles the actual loading of the LoRA model and applies it to the provided model.

This design allows for efficient loading and application of LoRA models while maintaining the flexibility to adapt to different use cases. By extending the LoraLoader class, LoraLoaderModelOnly leverages the existing functionality while streamlining the input requirements.

**Note**: When using the LoraLoaderModelOnly class, ensure that the specified LoRA file exists in the correct directory. The strength_model parameter should be set thoughtfully, as it directly affects the output model.

**Output Example**: A possible return value from the load_lora_model_only method could be a tuple containing the modified model, such as:
(model_lora_instance,)
### FunctionDef INPUT_TYPES(s)
**INPUT_TYPES**: The function of INPUT_TYPES is to define and return a dictionary of required input types for a model configuration.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· s: A parameter that is not utilized within the function body but is included for potential compatibility with other functions or frameworks.

- The "model" entry is associated with a tuple containing the string "MODEL", indicating that the input for this key should be of type MODEL.
- The "lora_name" entry utilizes the get_filename_list function from the ldm_patched.utils.path_utils module to dynamically retrieve a list of filenames from the "loras" directory. This allows for flexibility in specifying available LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) models that can be used in conjunction with the main model.
- The "strength_model" entry is defined as a floating-point number with specific constraints: a default value of 1.0, a minimum value of -20.0, a maximum value of 20.0, and a step increment of 0.01. This indicates that the strength of the model can be adjusted within this range, allowing for fine-tuning of the model's performance.

The INPUT_TYPES function is essential for ensuring that the correct types of inputs are provided when configuring models, particularly in contexts where multiple models or configurations may be used interchangeably. It serves as a foundational component for loaders such as CheckpointLoader, LoraLoader, and ControlNetLoader, which rely on this function to validate and manage input parameters effectively.

**Note**: When utilizing this function, it is important to ensure that the environment is set up correctly, particularly that the "loras" directory exists and contains valid filenames that can be retrieved by the get_filename_list function.

**Output Example**: An example of the return value from INPUT_TYPES could be:
```
{
    "required": {
        "model": ("MODEL",),
        "lora_name": (["lora1", "lora2", "lora3"],),
        "strength_model": ("FLOAT", {"default": 1.0, "min": -20.0, "max": 20.0, "step": 0.01}),
    }
}

### FunctionDef load_lora_model_only(self, model, lora_name, strength_model)
**load_lora_model_only**: The function of load_lora_model_only is to load Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) weights into a specified model without modifying any clip.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· model: The model object to which LoRA weights will be applied.  
· lora_name: A string representing the name of the LoRA file to be loaded.  
· strength_model: A float representing the strength of the LoRA application to the model.  

**Code Description**: The load_lora_model_only function is designed to facilitate the loading of LoRA weights specifically for a model. It achieves this by invoking the load_lora function from the LoraLoader class. In this context, the load_lora function is called with the model provided as an argument, while the clip parameter is set to None and the strength_clip is set to zero. This indicates that no modifications will be made to any clip, focusing solely on the model.

The load_lora function, which is called within load_lora_model_only, is responsible for loading the LoRA weights from the specified file and applying them to the model. It checks if the strengths for both the model and clip are zero; if so, it returns the original model and clip without any changes. If the strengths are non-zero, it retrieves the full path of the LoRA file and loads the weights accordingly, applying them to the model with the specified strength.

The output of load_lora_model_only is a tuple containing the modified model with the applied LoRA weights. The clip remains unchanged as it is not involved in this specific loading process.

**Note**: It is crucial to ensure that the provided lora_name corresponds to an existing file in the expected directory. Additionally, the model object should be compatible with the expected formats for the application of LoRA weights.

**Output Example**: A possible return value from load_lora_model_only could be a tuple containing the modified model, such as (modified_model,), where modified_model is the model with applied LoRA weights.

## ClassDef VAELoader
**VAELoader**: The function of VAELoader is to manage the loading of Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) from specified file paths.

**attributes**: The attributes of this Class.
· INPUT_TYPES: Specifies the required input types for the loading function, which includes the VAE name.
· RETURN_TYPES: Indicates the return type of the load function, which is a tuple containing a VAE object.
· FUNCTION: The name of the function that performs the loading operation, which is "load_vae".
· CATEGORY: Classifies the functionality of this class under "loaders".

**Code Description**: The VAELoader class provides static methods and class methods to facilitate the loading of Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) from the file system. It includes two primary static methods: `vae_list` and `load_taesd`, and a class method `load_vae`.

The `vae_list` method retrieves a list of available VAE filenames by calling the `get_filename_list` function from the `path_utils` module for both standard VAEs and approximate VAEs. It checks the filenames for specific prefixes to determine if certain types of encoders and decoders are present, specifically "taesd" and "taesdxl". If both an encoder and decoder for a type are found, that type is appended to the list of VAEs to be returned.

The `load_taesd` method is responsible for loading the parameters of a specified VAE type ("taesd" or "taesdxl"). It first fetches the list of approximate VAE filenames and uses filtering to find the corresponding encoder and decoder files. It then loads these files using the `load_torch_file` method and constructs a state dictionary (`sd`) that contains the loaded parameters. Depending on the VAE type, it also sets a specific scale factor in the state dictionary.

The `load_vae` method is the main entry point for loading a VAE. It checks if the requested VAE name is one of the special types ("taesd" or "taesdxl"). If so, it calls `load_taesd` to retrieve the parameters. For other VAE names, it constructs the full path to the VAE file and loads it directly. Finally, it creates a VAE object using the loaded state dictionary and returns it as a tuple.

**Note**: When using this class, ensure that the required VAE files are correctly placed in their respective directories. The class relies on the presence of specific naming conventions for the encoder and decoder files to function correctly.

**Output Example**: An example of the return value from the `load_vae` method could be a tuple containing a VAE object, such as:
(VAE(sd={'taesd_encoder.some_param': value, 'taesd_decoder.some_param': value, 'vae_scale': tensor_value}),)
### FunctionDef vae_list
**vae_list**: The function of vae_list is to retrieve a list of Variational Autoencoder (VAE) names based on the available files in specific directories.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· None

**Code Description**: The vae_list function operates by first calling the get_filename_list function from the ldm_patched.utils.path_utils module to obtain a list of filenames from the "vae" directory and another list from the "vae_approx" directory. It initializes several boolean flags to track the presence of specific encoder and decoder files related to two types of VAEs: "taesd" and "taesdxl".

The function iterates through the list of approximate VAEs (approx_vaes) to check for filenames that start with specific prefixes indicating the presence of encoder or decoder components. If both the encoder and decoder for "taesd" are found, it appends "taesd" to the vaes list. Similarly, if both components for "taesdxl" are detected, "taesdxl" is appended to the list.

Finally, the function returns the vaes list, which contains the names of the VAEs that were identified based on the files present in the specified directories. This function is called by the INPUT_TYPES function within the same module, which utilizes the output of vae_list to define the required input types for various operations, ensuring that the system dynamically adapts to the available VAEs.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the directories being accessed contain the appropriate files that match the expected naming conventions for the function to work correctly.

**Output Example**: A possible appearance of the code's return value could be:
```
['vae1', 'vae2', 'taesd', 'taesdxl']
```
***
### FunctionDef load_taesd(name)
**load_taesd**: The function of load_taesd is to load the encoder and decoder state dictionaries for a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) model based on the specified name.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· name: A string representing the name of the VAE model variant to be loaded, which can be "taesd" or "taesdxl".

**Code Description**: The load_taesd function is responsible for loading the state dictionaries of the encoder and decoder components of a VAE model. It begins by initializing an empty dictionary, sd, which will store the loaded state data. The function then retrieves a list of filenames from the "vae_approx" folder using the get_filename_list function. This list contains filenames that are expected to follow a naming convention indicating their roles as encoder or decoder.

Using the provided name, the function filters the list to find the corresponding encoder and decoder filenames. It constructs the full paths to these files by calling the get_full_path function, which ensures that the paths are correctly resolved based on the project's directory structure.

Next, the function loads the encoder's state dictionary using the load_torch_file function, which handles the loading of PyTorch model checkpoints. The loaded state dictionary is then processed to prefix each key with "taesd_encoder." before storing it in the sd dictionary. The same process is repeated for the decoder's state dictionary, prefixing the keys with "taesd_decoder.".

Additionally, the function checks the name parameter to determine the appropriate scaling factor for the VAE. If the name is "taesd", it sets the "vae_scale" key in the sd dictionary to a tensor value of 0.18215. If the name is "taesdxl", it sets the "vae_scale" key to 0.13025. Finally, the function returns the populated sd dictionary containing the state dictionaries for both the encoder and decoder, along with the scaling factor.

The load_taesd function is called by the load_vae method within the VAELoader class. This method checks if the requested VAE name is either "taesd" or "taesdxl" and, if so, invokes load_taesd to retrieve the corresponding state dictionaries. If the name does not match these values, it attempts to load the VAE from a different path.

**Note**: It is essential to ensure that the specified name corresponds to a valid VAE model variant, as the function relies on the correct naming conventions for the encoder and decoder files. Any discrepancies in the file structure or naming may result in errors during the loading process.

**Output Example**: A possible return value from load_taesd could be:
```python
{
    "taesd_encoder.layer1.weight": tensor([...]),
    "taesd_encoder.layer1.bias": tensor([...]),
    "taesd_decoder.layer1.weight": tensor([...]),
    "taesd_decoder.layer1.bias": tensor([...]),
    "vae_scale": tensor(0.18215)
}
```
***

· s: An object that contains the method vae_list, which retrieves the list of available VAE names.

**Code Description**: The INPUT_TYPES function is designed to return a dictionary that specifies the required input types for operations that utilize Variational Autoencoders. It takes a single parameter, `s`, which is expected to be an object that has access to the `vae_list()` method. This method is called within INPUT_TYPES to dynamically generate a list of VAE names based on the files present in specific directories.

The function constructs a dictionary with a key "required", which maps to another dictionary containing a single key-value pair. The key is "vae_name", and its value is a tuple containing the result of the `s.vae_list()` method call. This structure allows for the specification of input requirements in a clear and organized manner.

The relationship between INPUT_TYPES and its callees is crucial for its functionality. The INPUT_TYPES function relies on the `vae_list()` function to provide the necessary VAE names, ensuring that the input requirements are always aligned with the currently available VAEs in the system. This dynamic adaptation is essential for maintaining the integrity of operations that depend on specific VAE configurations.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the object passed as the parameter `s` has the `vae_list()` method implemented correctly, as the INPUT_TYPES function depends on this method to retrieve the list of VAE names.

**Output Example**: A possible appearance of the code's return value could be:
```
{"required": { "vae_name": (['vae1', 'vae2', 'taesd', 'taesdxl'], )}}
```
***
### FunctionDef load_vae(self, vae_name)
**load_vae**: The function of load_vae is to load a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) model based on the specified name.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· vae_name: A string representing the name of the VAE model to be loaded, which can be either "taesd" or "taesdxl".

**Code Description**: The load_vae function is responsible for loading a VAE model based on the provided vae_name. It first checks if the vae_name is either "taesd" or "taesdxl". If it matches one of these names, the function calls the load_taesd method to retrieve the state dictionaries for the encoder and decoder components of the VAE model. This method is specifically designed to handle the loading of these state dictionaries from predefined locations within the project.

If the vae_name does not match "taesd" or "taesdxl", the function constructs the full path to the VAE file using the get_full_path function from the path_utils module. This function ensures that the correct file path is retrieved based on the project's directory structure. The constructed path is then used to load the VAE model's state dictionary using the load_torch_file function from the modules.utils module. This function is capable of loading PyTorch model checkpoints from the specified file path.

Once the state dictionary (sd) is obtained, the load_vae function initializes a new instance of the VAE class, passing the loaded state dictionary to it. The VAE class is responsible for handling the encoding and decoding of images using the loaded model.

The load_vae function returns a tuple containing the initialized VAE instance. This function is integral to the process of loading VAE models within the project, allowing for flexibility in specifying different model variants and ensuring that the necessary state dictionaries are correctly loaded for further processing.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the vae_name provided corresponds to a valid VAE model variant, and that the necessary files exist in the expected directory structure. Any discrepancies may lead to errors during the loading process.

**Output Example**: A possible return value from load_vae could be an instance of the VAE class, represented as follows:
```python
(<VAE instance>)
```

***
## ClassDef ControlNetApply
**ControlNetApply**: The function of ControlNetApply is to apply a control network to a given conditioning input and image based on a specified strength.

**attributes**: The attributes of this Class.
· INPUT_TYPES: A class method that defines the required input types for the function, including conditioning, control_net, image, and strength.
· RETURN_TYPES: A tuple indicating the return type of the function, which is "CONDITIONING".
· FUNCTION: A string that specifies the name of the function to be executed, which is "apply_controlnet".
· CATEGORY: A string that categorizes the functionality of the class, labeled as "conditioning".

**Code Description**: The ControlNetApply class is designed to facilitate the application of a control network to a set of conditioning inputs and an image. The class defines a method called `apply_controlnet`, which takes four parameters: conditioning, control_net, image, and strength. 

The `INPUT_TYPES` class method specifies that the function requires four inputs: 
1. conditioning: A tuple representing the conditioning data.
2. control_net: A tuple representing the control network to be applied.
3. image: An image input that will be processed.
4. strength: A floating-point value that determines the intensity of the control network application, with a default value of 1.0 and a range from 0.0 to 10.0.

The `apply_controlnet` method begins by checking if the strength is zero. If it is, the method returns the conditioning input unchanged. If strength is greater than zero, the method proceeds to create a list `c` to hold the modified conditioning data. 

The image is adjusted by moving its last dimension to the second position using the `movedim` function. For each element in the conditioning input, a new entry is created that includes a copy of the conditioning data and a modified control network. The control network is updated with the control hint derived from the image and the specified strength. If the conditioning data contains a previous control network, it is set in the new control network. The new control network is then marked to apply to unconditioned data.

Finally, the method returns a tuple containing the modified conditioning data.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the strength parameter is within the specified range to avoid unexpected behavior. The control network must be properly configured before being passed to the method.

**Output Example**: A possible return value of the `apply_controlnet` method could look like this: 
(c, ) where `c` is a list of tuples, each containing the modified conditioning data and the associated control network settings. For example, it may return:
[
    (conditioning_data_1, {'control': control_network_1, 'control_apply_to_uncond': True}),
    (conditioning_data_2, {'control': control_network_2, 'control_apply_to_uncond': True}),
    ...
]
### FunctionDef INPUT_TYPES(s)
**INPUT_TYPES**: The function of INPUT_TYPES is to define and return the required input types for a specific operation involving conditioning, control net, image, and strength parameters.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· conditioning: This parameter is expected to be of type "CONDITIONING" and is required for the operation.
· control_net: This parameter is expected to be of type "CONTROL_NET" and is required for the operation.
· image: This parameter is expected to be of type "IMAGE" and is required for the operation.
· strength: This parameter is expected to be of type "FLOAT" and is required for the operation. It has additional constraints including a default value of 1.0, a minimum value of 0.0, a maximum value of 10.0, and a step increment of 0.01.

**Code Description**: The INPUT_TYPES function is designed to return a dictionary that specifies the required input types for a particular process. The dictionary contains a single key "required", which maps to another dictionary that outlines the specific parameters needed. Each parameter is associated with its respective type, indicating what kind of data is expected. The "strength" parameter is particularly noteworthy as it includes a set of constraints that define its valid range and default value, ensuring that the input adheres to specified limits. This structured approach allows for clear and organized input validation, making it easier for developers to understand what inputs are necessary for the function to operate correctly.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that all required parameters are provided when calling the function. The constraints on the "strength" parameter should be adhered to in order to avoid errors during execution.

**Output Example**: A possible appearance of the code's return value could be:
{
    "required": {
        "conditioning": ("CONDITIONING", ),
        "control_net": ("CONTROL_NET", ),
        "image": ("IMAGE", ),
        "strength": ("FLOAT", {"default": 1.0, "min": 0.0, "max": 10.0, "step": 0.01})
    }
}
***
### FunctionDef apply_controlnet(self, conditioning, control_net, image, strength)
**apply_controlnet**: The function of apply_controlnet is to apply a control network to a given conditioning input and image based on a specified strength.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· conditioning: A list of tuples, where each tuple contains a conditioning input and its associated metadata.
· control_net: An object representing the control network that will be applied to the conditioning inputs.
· image: An image tensor that serves as the control hint for the control network.
· strength: A float value indicating the strength of the control network application.

**Code Description**: The apply_controlnet function begins by checking if the strength parameter is equal to zero. If it is, the function returns the conditioning input as a single-element tuple, indicating that no control network application is performed. 

If the strength is greater than zero, the function initializes an empty list `c` to store the modified conditioning inputs. It then prepares the control hint by moving the last dimension of the image tensor to the second position using the `movedim` method. This rearrangement is necessary for the control network to properly interpret the image data.

The function then iterates over each tuple in the conditioning list. For each tuple, it creates a new list `n` that contains the original conditioning input and a copy of its associated metadata. A copy of the control_net is also created, and the control hint along with the strength is set using the `set_cond_hint` method of the control_net object. 

If the metadata of the conditioning input contains a 'control' key, the function sets the previous control network using the `set_previous_controlnet` method, ensuring that the control network has access to any prior control information. The modified control network is then stored in the metadata under the 'control' key, and a flag 'control_apply_to_uncond' is set to True, indicating that the control network should be applied to unconditioned inputs as well.

Finally, the modified conditioning input (now containing the updated control network) is appended to the list `c`. After processing all conditioning inputs, the function returns a single-element tuple containing the list `c`, which holds all the modified conditioning inputs ready for further processing.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the strength parameter is set appropriately, as a value of zero will bypass the control network application entirely. Additionally, the control_net and conditioning inputs must be compatible in terms of dimensions and expected formats.

**Output Example**: An example of the return value when applying the function could look like this:
```
([
    (original_conditioning_1, {'control': modified_control_net_1, 'control_apply_to_uncond': True}),
    (original_conditioning_2, {'control': modified_control_net_2, 'control_apply_to_uncond': True}),
    ...
])

## ClassDef ControlNetApplyAdvanced
**ControlNetApplyAdvanced**: The function of ControlNetApplyAdvanced is to apply control networks to conditioning inputs for image processing.

**attributes**: The attributes of this Class.
· INPUT_TYPES: Defines the required input types for the method, including positive and negative conditioning, control net, image, strength, start percentage, and end percentage.
· RETURN_TYPES: Specifies the types of outputs returned by the method, which are two CONDITIONING types.
· RETURN_NAMES: Names of the returned outputs, which are "positive" and "negative".
· FUNCTION: The name of the function that will be executed, which is "apply_controlnet".
· CATEGORY: The category under which this class is organized, labeled as "conditioning".

**Code Description**: The ControlNetApplyAdvanced class is designed to facilitate advanced image conditioning by applying control networks to specified inputs. The class contains a class method INPUT_TYPES that outlines the required inputs for the application, including two types of conditioning (positive and negative), a control network, an image, and several parameters that dictate the strength and range of the application. 

The core functionality is encapsulated in the method apply_controlnet, which takes in the defined parameters. If the strength parameter is set to zero, the method returns the original positive and negative conditioning without any modifications. Otherwise, it processes the image by adjusting its dimensions and prepares to apply the control network.

The method iterates through both positive and negative conditioning inputs, creating a copy of each conditioning's data. It checks if a previous control network exists and reuses it if available; otherwise, it creates a new control network instance, setting the necessary hints and parameters. Each conditioning is then updated with the new control network, and the results are collected and returned as a tuple of modified positive and negative conditioning.

This class is likely called from other parts of the project, such as modules/core.py, where the apply_controlnet function is utilized to enhance image processing capabilities by integrating control networks into the conditioning workflow.

**Note**: When using this class, ensure that the input parameters are within the specified ranges, particularly for strength, start_percent, and end_percent, to avoid unexpected behavior.

**Output Example**: A possible return value from the apply_controlnet method could be structured as follows:
```
(
    [
        [("positive_conditioning_1", {"control": "control_net_instance_1", ...})],
        [("positive_conditioning_2", {"control": "control_net_instance_2", ...})]
    ],
    [
        [("negative_conditioning_1", {"control": "control_net_instance_1", ...})],

**Code Description**: The INPUT_TYPES function constructs and returns a dictionary that specifies the required input types for a control net application. The dictionary is structured into a single key, "required", which maps to another dictionary containing various input types. Each input type is associated with a tuple that defines its category and, in some cases, additional constraints.

The input types defined in the returned dictionary include:
- "positive": This input type is categorized as "CONDITIONING", indicating that it is expected to provide positive conditioning data.
- "negative": Similar to "positive", this input type is also categorized as "CONDITIONING", but it is intended for negative conditioning data.
- "control_net": This input type is categorized as "CONTROL_NET", which likely refers to the control network data required for processing.
- "image": This input type is categorized as "IMAGE", indicating that an image input is necessary for the application.
- "strength": This input type is categorized as "FLOAT" and includes a dictionary of constraints specifying a default value of 1.0, a minimum value of 0.0, a maximum value of 10.0, and a step increment of 0.01.
- "start_percent": This input type is also categorized as "FLOAT" and has constraints that define a default value of 0.0, a minimum value of 0.0, a maximum value of 1.0, and a step increment of 0.001.
- "end_percent": Similar to "start_percent", this input type is categorized as "FLOAT" with the same constraints for default, minimum, maximum, and step values.

This structured approach allows for clear definition and validation of the inputs required for the control net application, ensuring that users provide the necessary data in the correct format.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the values provided for "strength", "start_percent", and "end_percent" adhere to the specified constraints to avoid errors during processing.

**Output Example**: An example of the return value from the INPUT_TYPES function would be:
{
    "required": {
        "positive": ("CONDITIONING", ),
        "negative": ("CONDITIONING", ),

### FunctionDef apply_controlnet(self, positive, negative, control_net, image, strength, start_percent, end_percent)
**apply_controlnet**: The function of apply_controlnet is to apply control networks to positive and negative conditioning inputs based on specified parameters.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· positive: This parameter represents the positive conditioning inputs that will be processed by the control network.
· negative: This parameter represents the negative conditioning inputs that will also be processed by the control network.
· control_net: This parameter is the control network instance that will be applied to the conditioning inputs.
· image: This parameter is the image from which the control hint will be derived, specifically its dimensions.
· strength: This parameter defines the strength of the control network's influence, with a value of zero indicating no application of the control network.
· start_percent: This parameter specifies the starting percentage of the timestep range over which the control network will be applied.
· end_percent: This parameter specifies the ending percentage of the timestep range over which the control network will be applied.

**Code Description**: The apply_controlnet function is designed to manage the application of control networks to given conditioning inputs (both positive and negative). It begins by checking if the strength parameter is zero; if it is, the function immediately returns the positive and negative inputs unchanged, indicating that no control network application is necessary. 

If the strength is greater than zero, the function proceeds to manipulate the image dimensions to create a control hint by moving the last dimension of the image to the second position. This control hint is essential for the control network's operation. The function then initializes an empty dictionary, cnets, to keep track of the control networks that have already been created for each conditioning input.

The function iterates over both the positive and negative conditioning inputs. For each conditioning input, it creates a list to hold the processed results. Within this loop, it further iterates over each element in the conditioning input. For each element, it makes a copy of the associated dictionary to avoid modifying the original data.

The function checks if a control network has already been created for the current conditioning by examining the 'control' key in the copied dictionary. If a control network exists, it retrieves it from the cnets dictionary. If not, it creates a new control network by copying the provided control_net instance and invoking the set_cond_hint method. This method is called with the control hint, strength, and the specified timestep percent range (start_percent, end_percent), establishing the necessary parameters for the control network.

The new control network is then assigned to the 'control' key in the copied dictionary, and a flag 'control_apply_to_uncond' is set to False. The processed element, now containing the control network, is appended to the list for the current conditioning input.

After processing both positive and negative conditioning inputs, the function returns a tuple containing the processed positive and negative conditioning inputs, each with their respective control networks applied.

**Note**: It is crucial to ensure that the strength parameter is set appropriately, as a value of zero will bypass the control network application. Additionally, the control hint derived from the image must be compatible with the control network's requirements to avoid runtime errors.

**Output Example**: A possible appearance of the code's return value could be a tuple containing two lists, each with elements structured as follows:
```
(
    [
        [<positive_input_1>, {'control': <ControlNetInstance>, 'control_apply_to_uncond': False}],
        [<positive_input_2>, {'control': <ControlNetInstance>, 'control_apply_to_uncond': False}],
        ...
    ],
    [
        [<negative_input_1>, {'control': <ControlNetInstance>, 'control_apply_to_uncond': False}],
        [<negative_input_2>, {'control': <ControlNetInstance>, 'control_apply_to_uncond': False}],
        ...
    ]
)
```

**apply_stylemodel**: The function of apply_stylemodel is to process the output of a vision model using a style model and conditioning inputs to generate a modified output.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· clip_vision_output: This parameter represents the output from a vision model, which is used as input for the style model to derive conditioning information.
· style_model: This parameter is an instance of a style model that is responsible for generating conditioning data based on the clip_vision_output.
· conditioning: This parameter is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two elements. The first element is a tensor that will be concatenated with the conditioning data, and the second element is a copy of the first element, which may represent additional information or metadata.

**Code Description**: The apply_stylemodel function begins by invoking the get_cond method of the style_model, passing in the clip_vision_output. This method processes the output and returns a tensor that is then flattened to merge dimensions 0 and 1, followed by adding a new dimension at the start (dim=0) using the unsqueeze method. The resulting tensor, referred to as 'cond', serves as the conditioning data for the subsequent operations.

The function initializes an empty list 'c' to store the processed conditioning data. It then iterates over each element 't' in the conditioning list. For each 't', it constructs a new list 'n' that contains two elements: the first element is a concatenation of the first element of 't' and the 'cond' tensor along dimension 1, and the second element is a copy of the second element of 't'. This new list 'n' is appended to the list 'c'.

Finally, the function returns a tuple containing the list 'c', which holds the modified conditioning data ready for further processing.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the dimensions of the tensors being concatenated are compatible. The function assumes that the style_model and conditioning inputs are properly configured to work with the clip_vision_output.

**Output Example**: A possible appearance of the code's return value could be:
```
([
    [tensor([[...], [...]]), tensor([[...], [...]])],
    [tensor([[...], [...]]), tensor([[...], [...]])],
    ...
],)
``` 
This output indicates a tuple containing a list of modified conditioning data, where each entry consists of concatenated tensors and their corresponding copies.
***
## ClassDef unCLIPConditioning
**unCLIPConditioning**: The function of unCLIPConditioning is to apply conditioning transformations based on CLIP vision output, strength, and noise augmentation parameters.

**attributes**: The attributes of this Class.
· INPUT_TYPES: A class method that defines the required input types for the conditioning process, including conditioning data, CLIP vision output, strength, and noise augmentation.
· RETURN_TYPES: Specifies the output type of the function, which is a tuple containing "CONDITIONING".
· FUNCTION: The name of the method that will be executed, which is "apply_adm".
· CATEGORY: The category under which this class is classified, which is "conditioning".

**Code Description**: The unCLIPConditioning class is designed to facilitate the application of conditioning transformations in a machine learning context, particularly when working with outputs from a CLIP (Contrastive Language–Image Pretraining) model. The class contains a class method INPUT_TYPES that specifies the necessary input parameters for the conditioning process. These parameters include:
- conditioning: A required input representing the conditioning data.
- clip_vision_output: A required input representing the output from the CLIP vision model.
- strength: A floating-point value that determines the intensity of the conditioning transformation, with a default value of 1.0 and a range from -10.0 to 10.0.
- noise_augmentation: A floating-point value that adds noise to the conditioning process, with a default value of 0.0 and a range from 0.0 to 1.0.

The main functionality is encapsulated in the apply_adm method, which takes the aforementioned parameters. If the strength parameter is set to zero, the method returns the original conditioning data unchanged. Otherwise, it processes each element in the conditioning input. For each element, it creates a copy of the associated data and constructs a dictionary containing the clip vision output, strength, and noise augmentation values. This dictionary is then appended to the "unclip_conditioning" key within the copied data. If the key does not exist, it initializes it with the new dictionary. The method ultimately returns a list of transformed conditioning data.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the input parameters are provided in the correct format and within the specified ranges to avoid runtime errors. The conditioning transformation is sensitive to the values of strength and noise augmentation, which can significantly affect the output.

**Output Example**: A possible appearance of the code's return value could be:
[
    [0, {"unclip_conditioning": [{"clip_vision_output": ..., "strength": 1.0, "noise_augmentation": 0.0}]}],
    [1, {"unclip_conditioning": [{"clip_vision_output": ..., "strength": 1.0, "noise_augmentation": 0.5}]}]

· noise_augmentation: This parameter is expected to be of type "FLOAT". It has a default value of 0.0 and must be within the range of 0.0 to 1.0, with a step increment of 0.01.

**Code Description**: The INPUT_TYPES function is designed to return a dictionary that specifies the required input types for a conditioning operation. The dictionary contains a single key, "required", which maps to another dictionary that outlines the specific inputs needed. Each input is defined by its name and a tuple that specifies its type and, in some cases, additional constraints. The "conditioning" and "clip_vision_output" inputs are straightforward, requiring specific types. The "strength" and "noise_augmentation" inputs are of type FLOAT, with defined default values, minimum and maximum limits, and step sizes for incrementing their values. This structured approach ensures that the inputs are validated and constrained appropriately during the conditioning process.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the values provided for "strength" and "noise_augmentation" adhere to their specified ranges and increments to avoid errors during execution.

**Output Example**: A possible return value of the INPUT_TYPES function could look like this:
{
    "required": {
        "conditioning": ("CONDITIONING", ),
        "clip_vision_output": ("CLIP_VISION_OUTPUT", ),
        "strength": ("FLOAT", {"default": 1.0, "min": -10.0, "max": 10.0, "step": 0.01}),

· strength: A numerical value that determines the intensity of the modification applied to the conditioning data.
· noise_augmentation: A parameter that specifies the level of noise to be added during the conditioning modification process.

**Code Description**: The apply_adm function processes the conditioning data by iterating through each element in the conditioning list. If the strength parameter is zero, the function returns the original conditioning data unchanged. For each element in the conditioning list, it creates a copy of the associated dictionary and constructs a new dictionary that includes the clip vision output, strength, and noise augmentation. If the key "unclip_conditioning" exists in the copied dictionary, the function appends the new dictionary to the existing list; otherwise, it initializes this key with a new list containing the new dictionary. The modified conditioning data is then collected into a new list, which is returned as a tuple.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the strength parameter is not set to zero if modifications to the conditioning data are desired. The function assumes that the conditioning list is well-formed and that each element adheres to the expected structure.

**Output Example**: A possible return value of the function could be:
(
    [
        (timestamp1, {"unclip_conditioning": [{"clip_vision_output": output1, "strength": strength_value, "noise_augmentation": noise_value}]}),
        (timestamp2, {"unclip_conditioning": [{"clip_vision_output": output2, "strength": strength_value, "noise_augmentation": noise_value}]})

```
Where `gligen_object` represents the loaded GLIGEN instance.
### FunctionDef INPUT_TYPES(s)
**INPUT_TYPES**: The function of INPUT_TYPES is to define the required input types for the GLIGENLoader, specifically returning a mapping of input parameters.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· s: This parameter is a placeholder for the input to the function, although it is not utilized within the function body.

**Code Description**: The INPUT_TYPES function constructs and returns a dictionary that specifies the required input types for the GLIGENLoader. The dictionary contains a single key, "required", which maps to another dictionary. This inner dictionary has one key, "gligen_name", which is associated with a tuple containing the result of the function call to ldm_patched.utils.path_utils.get_filename_list("gligen"). 

The get_filename_list function is responsible for retrieving a list of filenames from a specified folder, in this case, the "gligen" folder. This function utilizes caching to enhance performance, ensuring that repeated calls for the same folder do not require accessing the filesystem each time. The INPUT_TYPES function thus relies on get_filename_list to dynamically provide the available filenames from the "gligen" directory, ensuring that the GLIGENLoader operates with the most current data.

By returning this structured input type information, INPUT_TYPES facilitates the validation and processing of inputs for the GLIGENLoader, making it easier for developers to understand what inputs are necessary for the loader to function correctly.

**Note**: When utilizing this function, it is important to ensure that the "gligen" folder exists and is correctly configured within the project structure, as the function relies on the successful execution of get_filename_list to return valid filenames.

**Output Example**: An example of the return value from INPUT_TYPES could be:
```
{"required": { "gligen_name": (['file1.gligen', 'file2.gligen'],) }}
```
***
### FunctionDef load_gligen(self, gligen_name)
**load_gligen**: The function of load_gligen is to load a GLIGEN model based on its name by retrieving its full file path and loading the model from that path.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· gligen_name: A string representing the name of the GLIGEN model to be loaded.

**Code Description**: The load_gligen function is designed to facilitate the loading of a GLIGEN model by first determining the full path to the model file using the gligen_name provided as an argument. It utilizes the get_full_path function from the ldm_patched.utils.path_utils module to obtain the complete file path. The get_full_path function takes two parameters: a folder name ("gligen") and the model name (gligen_name). If the folder exists and the specified file is found, get_full_path returns the full path to the GLIGEN model file.

Once the full path is retrieved, the load_gligen function calls the load_gligen method from the ldm_patched.modules.sd module, passing the obtained gligen_path as an argument. This method is responsible for loading the GLIGEN model from the specified path. The load_gligen function then returns a tuple containing the loaded GLIGEN model.

This function plays a critical role in the project by ensuring that the GLIGEN models can be dynamically loaded based on their names, which allows for flexibility and modularity in model management. It is particularly useful in scenarios where different models may need to be loaded at runtime based on user input or configuration settings.

**Note**: It is essential to ensure that the gligen_name provided to this function corresponds to an existing GLIGEN model file within the "gligen" folder. If the model name is incorrect or the file does not exist, the function will not be able to load the model, potentially leading to errors in the application.

**Output Example**: A possible return value from load_gligen could be a tuple containing the loaded GLIGEN model object, such as (gligen_model_instance,), where gligen_model_instance represents the instance of the loaded GLIGEN model.

It contains a class method INPUT_TYPES that outlines the required inputs for the conditioning process. The inputs include conditioning_to, clip, gligen_textbox_model, text, width, height, x, and y, each with specified types and constraints. The RETURN_TYPES attribute indicates that the method will return a tuple containing a single element of type "CONDITIONING". The FUNCTION attribute specifies that the method to be executed is "append".

The append method takes the specified input parameters and processes them to generate a conditioning output. It begins by initializing an empty list, c. The method then encodes the input clip using the provided text, returning both the encoded conditioning and pooled conditioning. For each item in conditioning_to, it creates a new entry by copying the existing conditioning data and appending the GLIGEN text box parameters. The position parameters are calculated based on the provided width, height, x, and y values, which are scaled down by a factor of 8. If the existing conditioning data contains a "gligen" key, it retrieves the previous parameters to ensure continuity in the conditioning process. Finally, the method appends the newly constructed conditioning data to the list c and returns it as a tuple.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the input parameters adhere to the specified constraints, such as minimum and maximum values for width, height, x, and y, to avoid runtime errors. The text input should be provided as a multiline string to accommodate longer text entries.

**Output Example**: A possible appearance of the code's return value could be:
[
    (conditioning_id_1, {'gligen': ('position', gligen_textbox_model, previous_params + [(encoded_cond_pooled, height // 8, width // 8, y // 8, x // 8)])}),

The function ensures that all necessary parameters are defined with appropriate types and constraints, facilitating validation and proper handling of user inputs in the GLIGEN Text Box application.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the values provided for width, height, x, and y adhere to the defined constraints to avoid errors during execution. The constants MAX_RESOLUTION should be defined elsewhere in the code to ensure proper functionality.

**Output Example**: A possible return value of the INPUT_TYPES function could look like this:
{
    "required": {
        "conditioning_to": ("CONDITIONING", ),
        "clip": ("CLIP", ),
        "gligen_textbox_model": ("GLIGEN", ),
        "text": ("STRING", {"multiline": True}),
        "width": ("INT", {"default": 64, "min": 8, "max": 1024, "step": 8}),
        "height": ("INT", {"default": 64, "min": 8, "max": 1024, "step": 8}),
        "x": ("INT", {"default": 0, "min": 0, "max": 1024, "step": 8}),
        "y": ("INT", {"default": 0, "min": 0, "max": 1024, "step": 8}),
    }
}

### FunctionDef append(self, conditioning_to, clip, gligen_textbox_model, text, width, height, x, y)
**append**: The function of append is to modify a list of conditioning parameters by encoding text and updating the parameters based on the provided model and position.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· conditioning_to: A list of tuples where each tuple contains an identifier and a dictionary of parameters to be modified.
· clip: An object that provides methods for encoding and tokenizing text.
· gligen_textbox_model: A model used for generating position parameters related to the GLIGEN text box.
· text: A string of text that needs to be tokenized and encoded.
· width: An integer representing the width of the area where the text box will be applied.
· height: An integer representing the height of the area where the text box will be applied.
· x: An integer representing the x-coordinate for positioning the text box.
· y: An integer representing the y-coordinate for positioning the text box.

**Code Description**: The append function begins by initializing an empty list `c` to store the modified conditioning parameters. It then encodes the provided `text` using the `clip` object, which tokenizes the text and returns both the encoded representation and a pooled version of the encoding. The function iterates over each tuple in the `conditioning_to` list. For each tuple, it creates a new list `n` that contains the original identifier and a copy of the associated parameters. It calculates the position parameters based on the pooled encoding and the dimensions provided (height and width), scaling them down by a factor of 8. If the dictionary of parameters contains a key "gligen", it retrieves the previous position parameters associated with that key. The function then updates the "gligen" key in the parameters dictionary with a new tuple that includes the type of operation ("position"), the `gligen_textbox_model`, and the newly calculated position parameters. Finally, the modified list `n` is appended to the list `c`, which is returned as a single-element tuple.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the `clip` object has the necessary methods (`encode_from_tokens` and `tokenize`) implemented, as the function relies on these for processing the input text. Additionally, the structure of the `conditioning_to` list must be maintained, as the function expects tuples with specific formats.

**Output Example**: An example of the return value of the function could look like this:
```
([
    ('id1', {'gligen': ('position', gligen_textbox_model, [encoded_params])}),
    ('id2', {'gligen': ('position', gligen_textbox_model, [encoded_params])})
])
```
In this example, `encoded_params` would represent the calculated position parameters based on the input dimensions and text encoding.

## ClassDef EmptyLatentImage
**EmptyLatentImage**: The function of EmptyLatentImage is to generate a latent image tensor filled with zeros based on specified dimensions and batch size.

**attributes**: The attributes of this Class.
· device: This attribute holds the intermediate device used for tensor operations, initialized during the instantiation of the class.

**Code Description**: The EmptyLatentImage class is designed to create a latent image tensor that is initialized to zero. This is particularly useful in scenarios where a blank or empty latent representation is required, such as in generative models or during the initialization of certain processes in machine learning workflows.

Upon instantiation, the class initializes the `device` attribute by calling `ldm_patched.modules.model_management.intermediate_device()`, which determines the appropriate device (CPU or GPU) for tensor operations. This ensures that the generated latent images are created on the correct hardware, optimizing performance.

The class provides a class method `INPUT_TYPES`, which specifies the required input types for the `generate` method. It expects three parameters: `width`, `height`, and `batch_size`. Each parameter has defined constraints, such as default values and acceptable ranges. The `RETURN_TYPES` attribute indicates that the output of the `generate` method will be of type "LATENT".

The `generate` method takes the specified `width`, `height`, and `batch_size` as inputs. It computes the dimensions for the latent tensor by dividing the height and width by 8, which is a common practice in latent space representations. The method then creates a tensor filled with zeros using `torch.zeros`, specifying the shape based on the input parameters and the device. The output is returned as a dictionary containing the key "samples" with the latent tensor as its value.

From a functional perspective, the EmptyLatentImage class can be called by other modules within the project, such as `modules/core.py`. This indicates that it plays a role in the broader context of the project, likely serving as a foundational component for generating latent representations that can be utilized in various machine learning tasks.

**Note**: When using the EmptyLatentImage class, ensure that the input parameters adhere to the specified constraints to avoid runtime errors. The generated latent tensor will be of shape `[batch_size, 4, height // 8, width // 8]`, which is essential for subsequent processing in models that utilize latent representations.

**Output Example**: A possible appearance of the code's return value when calling the `generate` method with parameters `width=512`, `height=512`, and `batch_size=1` would be:
```
{
    "samples": tensor([[[[0., 0., 0., ..., 0., 0., 0.],
                         [0., 0., 0., ..., 0., 0., 0.],
                         ...,
                         [0., 0., 0., ..., 0., 0., 0.]]]]], device='cuda:0')
}
```
### FunctionDef __init__(self)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize the EmptyLatentImage class and set the device for processing latent images.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· There are no parameters for this function.

**Code Description**: The __init__ method is a constructor for the EmptyLatentImage class. Its primary role is to initialize an instance of the class by setting up the device that will be used for processing latent images. This is achieved by calling the intermediate_device function from the ldm_patched.modules.model_management module.

The intermediate_device function determines the appropriate PyTorch device (either CPU or GPU) based on the user's configuration. By invoking this function, the __init__ method ensures that the EmptyLatentImage class operates on the correct device, which is crucial for efficient computation and resource management during model inference and training.

The relationship between the __init__ method and the intermediate_device function is integral to the functionality of the EmptyLatentImage class. By setting the device during initialization, the class can leverage the selected computing resource throughout its methods, thereby enhancing performance and ensuring compatibility with the user's hardware setup.

This initialization process is essential for any subsequent operations that the EmptyLatentImage class may perform, as it guarantees that all computations are executed on the designated device, whether it be a GPU or CPU.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the global variable `args` is properly configured before the __init__ method is called, as this will influence the behavior of the intermediate_device function and, consequently, the device that is set for the EmptyLatentImage class.
***
### FunctionDef INPUT_TYPES(s)
**INPUT_TYPES**: The function of INPUT_TYPES is to define and return the required input types for a specific operation, including width, height, and batch size.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· s: This parameter is not utilized within the function body and serves as a placeholder for potential future use or for compatibility with a specific interface.

**Code Description**: The INPUT_TYPES function constructs a dictionary that specifies the required input parameters for a process. The dictionary contains a single key, "required", which maps to another dictionary detailing three parameters: "width", "height", and "batch_size". Each of these parameters is defined with a tuple that includes the type of the parameter and a dictionary of constraints.

- "width" and "height" are both defined as integers ("INT") with the following constraints:
  - "default": 512, indicating that if no value is provided, the default value will be 512.
  - "min": 16, which sets the minimum allowable value for both parameters.
  - "max": MAX_RESOLUTION, which is a variable that should be defined elsewhere in the code, representing the maximum allowable resolution.
  - "step": 8, indicating that the values for width and height can be incremented in steps of 8.

- "batch_size" is also defined as an integer ("INT") with its own set of constraints:
  - "default": 1, meaning that the default batch size is 1.
  - "min": 1, which sets the minimum batch size to 1.
  - "max": 4096, establishing the maximum batch size limit.

This structured approach ensures that the inputs are validated against defined constraints, promoting robustness and preventing errors during execution.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the MAX_RESOLUTION variable is defined in the scope where this function is used, as it is critical for the proper functioning of the width and height constraints.

**Output Example**: An example of the return value from the INPUT_TYPES function would be:
{
    "required": {
        "width": ("INT", {"default": 512, "min": 16, "max": MAX_RESOLUTION, "step": 8}),
        "height": ("INT", {"default": 512, "min": 16, "max": MAX_RESOLUTION, "step": 8}),
        "batch_size": ("INT", {"default": 1, "min": 1, "max": 4096})
    }
}
***
### FunctionDef generate(self, width, height, batch_size)
**generate**: The function of generate is to create a latent image tensor filled with zeros based on specified dimensions and batch size.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· parameter1: width - An integer representing the width of the latent image to be generated.
· parameter2: height - An integer representing the height of the latent image to be generated.
· parameter3: batch_size - An optional integer (default is 1) that specifies the number of latent images to generate in a single batch.

**Code Description**: The generate function initializes a tensor filled with zeros, which represents a latent image. The dimensions of this tensor are determined by the provided width and height parameters, which are divided by 8 to account for the scaling typically used in latent space representations. The tensor is created with a shape of [batch_size, 4, height // 8, width // 8], where '4' represents the number of channels in the latent image. This tensor is allocated on the device specified by self.device, ensuring that it is ready for use in computations that may involve GPU acceleration.

The function returns a tuple containing a dictionary with the key "samples" that maps to the generated latent tensor. This structure allows for easy integration with other components of the system that may expect a specific output format.

The generate function is called by the generate_empty_latent function defined in modules/core.py. This higher-level function serves as a convenient wrapper, allowing users to generate a latent image without directly interacting with the underlying implementation details of the generate function. It provides default values for width, height, and batch_size, making it user-friendly for quick calls while still allowing for customization.

**Note**: When using this function, ensure that the width and height parameters are multiples of 8 to avoid unexpected behavior, as the dimensions are scaled down by a factor of 8 during tensor creation.

**Output Example**: A possible appearance of the code's return value when calling generate with width=1024, height=1024, and batch_size=1 might look like this:
```
({"samples": tensor([[[[0., 0., 0., ..., 0., 0., 0.],
                       [0., 0., 0., ..., 0., 0., 0.],
                       ...,
                       [0., 0., 0., ..., 0., 0., 0.]]]]])},)
```

## ClassDef LatentFromBatch
**LatentFromBatch**: The function of LatentFromBatch is to extract a specific segment of latent samples from a larger batch based on given indices.

**attributes**: The attributes of this Class.
· INPUT_TYPES: Defines the required input types for the method, including samples, batch_index, and length.  
· RETURN_TYPES: Specifies the return type of the method, which is a latent sample.  
· FUNCTION: Indicates the name of the function to be executed, which is "frombatch".  
· CATEGORY: Categorizes the function under "latent/batch".

**Code Description**: The LatentFromBatch class is designed to handle latent samples in a batch processing context. It provides a class method INPUT_TYPES that outlines the necessary inputs for the frombatch method. The required inputs include:
- "samples": A LATENT type that contains the latent data.
- "batch_index": An integer that specifies the starting index of the batch to extract, with a default value of 0 and constraints on its minimum and maximum values.
- "length": An integer that determines how many samples to extract from the batch, with a default value of 1 and constraints on its minimum and maximum values.

The frombatch method takes these inputs and processes them as follows:
1. It creates a copy of the input samples to avoid modifying the original data.
2. It retrieves the latent samples from the input and ensures that the batch_index does not exceed the available range of samples.
3. It calculates the effective length of samples to extract based on the batch_index and the specified length.
4. If a noise mask is present in the input samples, it handles the mask appropriately, ensuring it matches the shape of the extracted samples.
5. The method also manages the batch_index in the output, either by generating a new list of indices or by slicing the existing batch_index from the input samples.
6. Finally, it returns the processed samples as a tuple.

**Note**: When using this class, ensure that the input samples contain the necessary structure and that the batch_index and length parameters are within the defined limits to avoid index errors.

**Output Example**: A possible return value of the frombatch method might look like this:
{
  "samples": tensor([[...], [...], ...]),  // Extracted latent samples
  "noise_mask": tensor([[...], [...], ...]),  // Corresponding noise mask if available
  "batch_index": [0, 1, 2]  // Indices of the extracted samples
}
### FunctionDef INPUT_TYPES(s)
**INPUT_TYPES**: The function of INPUT_TYPES is to define and return the required input types for a specific operation involving latent samples and batch processing.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· samples: This parameter expects a type of "LATENT", which indicates that the input should consist of latent representations.
· batch_index: This parameter is of type "INT" and has additional constraints, including a default value of 0, a minimum value of 0, and a maximum value of 63. It specifies the index of the batch to be processed.
· length: This parameter is also of type "INT" with constraints, including a default value of 1, a minimum value of 1, and a maximum value of 64. It indicates the length of the samples to be processed.

**Code Description**: The INPUT_TYPES function is designed to return a dictionary that specifies the required input types for a particular function or operation. The dictionary contains a single key "required", which maps to another dictionary detailing the specific parameters needed. The "samples" parameter is required to be of type "LATENT", indicating that the function expects latent data as input. The "batch_index" parameter is an integer that defaults to 0, with constraints ensuring it falls within the range of 0 to 63. This parameter allows the user to specify which batch of data to process. The "length" parameter is also an integer, with a default of 1 and constraints that require it to be between 1 and 64. This parameter defines how many latent samples should be processed in the operation.

**Note**: When using this function, ensure that the values provided for "batch_index" and "length" adhere to the specified constraints to avoid errors during execution. The "samples" input must be properly formatted as latent data.

**Output Example**: A possible appearance of the code's return value could be:
{
    "required": {
        "samples": ("LATENT",),
        "batch_index": ("INT", {"default": 0, "min": 0, "max": 63}),
        "length": ("INT", {"default": 1, "min": 1, "max": 64}),
    }
}
***
### FunctionDef frombatch(self, samples, batch_index, length)
**frombatch**: The function of frombatch is to extract a subset of samples and their associated metadata from a given batch of data.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· samples: A dictionary containing the data samples and potentially other associated information such as noise masks and batch indices.
· batch_index: An integer indicating the starting index from which to extract samples from the batch.
· length: An integer specifying the number of samples to extract starting from the batch_index.

**Code Description**: The frombatch function begins by creating a copy of the input samples dictionary to avoid modifying the original data. It retrieves the "samples" array from the input dictionary and ensures that the batch_index does not exceed the bounds of the array. The length of the samples to be extracted is also constrained to ensure it does not exceed the available data from the batch_index onward. The function then updates the "samples" key in the copied dictionary with a cloned subset of the samples based on the specified batch_index and length.

If a "noise_mask" is present in the input samples, the function checks its shape. If there is only one mask, it clones this mask directly into the output. If there are multiple masks, the function ensures that the number of masks matches the number of samples by repeating the masks as necessary. The relevant subset of the noise masks is then cloned and added to the output dictionary.

The function also manages the "batch_index" key in the output. If "batch_index" is not already present in the output dictionary, it generates a list of indices corresponding to the extracted samples. If it is present, it updates this key with the relevant indices from the input samples.

Finally, the function returns a tuple containing the modified samples dictionary.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the input samples dictionary contains the expected keys ("samples" and optionally "noise_mask" and "batch_index") to avoid key errors. The function is designed to handle cases where the input data may not fully match the expected dimensions.

**Output Example**: An example of the return value when calling frombatch with a samples dictionary containing 10 samples, a batch_index of 2, and a length of 3 might look like this:
{
    "samples": tensor([[...], [...], [...]]),  # 3 samples extracted starting from index 2
    "noise_mask": tensor([[...], [...], [...]]),  # Corresponding noise masks if present
    "batch_index": [2, 3, 4]  # Indices of the extracted samples
}
***
## ClassDef RepeatLatentBatch
**RepeatLatentBatch**: The function of RepeatLatentBatch is to repeat latent samples a specified number of times, optionally adjusting associated noise masks and batch indices.

**attributes**: The attributes of this Class.
· INPUT_TYPES: Specifies the required input types for the class method, including samples and amount.
· RETURN_TYPES: Defines the return type of the function, which is a tuple containing "LATENT".
· FUNCTION: Indicates the name of the function to be executed, which is "repeat".
· CATEGORY: Categorizes the class under "latent/batch".

**Code Description**: The RepeatLatentBatch class is designed to facilitate the repetition of latent samples in a batch processing context. It contains a class method INPUT_TYPES that outlines the necessary inputs for its functionality. The required inputs are:
- "samples": A LATENT type input that contains the latent data to be repeated.
- "amount": An INT type input that specifies how many times the latent samples should be repeated, with constraints on its value (default is 1, minimum is 1, and maximum is 64).

The class also defines RETURN_TYPES, which indicates that the output will be a tuple containing the repeated latent samples. The FUNCTION attribute specifies that the core functionality of this class is encapsulated in the "repeat" method.

The repeat method itself takes two parameters: samples and amount. It begins by creating a copy of the input samples. The latent samples are then repeated according to the specified amount using the repeat method from the tensor library, which allows for the expansion of the latent data across the first dimension.

If a noise mask is present in the input samples and contains more than one entry, the method checks if the number of masks is less than the number of latent samples. If so, it repeats the masks to ensure that they match the number of latent samples. The noise mask is then also repeated according to the specified amount.

Additionally, if a batch index is present in the samples, the method calculates an offset based on the existing batch indices and adjusts them to ensure that the new batch indices reflect the repetition of the samples. This is done by adding an incremented value to each existing index for each repetition.

Finally, the method returns a tuple containing the modified samples, which now include the repeated latent samples, adjusted noise masks (if applicable), and updated batch indices.

**Note**: When using this class, ensure that the input samples are structured correctly and that the amount parameter is within the specified limits to avoid errors during execution.

**Output Example**: An example output of the repeat method when called with a latent sample of shape (2, 3, 4, 4) and an amount of 3 might look like this:
```
{
    "samples": tensor of shape (6, 3, 4, 4),  # Repeated latent samples
    "noise_mask": tensor of shape (6, 1, 4, 4),  # Repeated noise mask if present
    "batch_index": [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1]  # Updated batch indices reflecting the repetitions
}
```
### FunctionDef INPUT_TYPES(s)
**INPUT_TYPES**: The function of INPUT_TYPES is to define and return the required input types for a specific operation involving latent samples and an integer amount.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· samples: This parameter is expected to be of type "LATENT", which indicates that the function requires latent representations as input.
· amount: This parameter is of type "INT" and has additional constraints, including a default value of 1, a minimum value of 1, and a maximum value of 64.

**Code Description**: The INPUT_TYPES function is designed to specify the input requirements for a particular process. It returns a dictionary that categorizes the inputs into a "required" section. Within this section, two keys are defined: "samples" and "amount". The "samples" key is associated with a tuple containing the string "LATENT", indicating that the function expects latent data as input. The "amount" key is associated with a tuple that includes the string "INT" and a dictionary specifying constraints on the integer value. The constraints ensure that the amount must be at least 1 and can go up to a maximum of 64, with a default value set to 1. This structured approach allows for clear validation of input types and their respective constraints, facilitating proper usage in subsequent operations.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the inputs provided to the function adhere to the specified types and constraints. Failing to do so may result in errors or unexpected behavior during execution.

**Output Example**: An example of the return value from the INPUT_TYPES function would be:
{
    "required": {
        "samples": ("LATENT",),
        "amount": ("INT", {"default": 1, "min": 1, "max": 64}),
    }
}
***
### FunctionDef repeat(self, samples, amount)
**repeat**: The function of repeat is to duplicate the provided samples a specified number of times while maintaining the integrity of associated data such as noise masks and batch indices.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· samples: A dictionary containing the data to be repeated, which may include keys such as "samples", "noise_mask", and "batch_index".
· amount: An integer indicating how many times the samples should be duplicated.

**Code Description**: The repeat function begins by creating a copy of the input samples to avoid modifying the original data. It extracts the "samples" from the input dictionary and uses the `repeat` method to duplicate the sample data according to the specified amount. The shape of the repeated samples is adjusted to ensure that the dimensions remain consistent.

If the input samples contain a "noise_mask" and its shape indicates that it has more than one entry, the function checks if the number of masks is less than the number of original samples. If so, it repeats the masks sufficiently to cover the required number of samples, ensuring that the final output matches the number of repeated samples.

Additionally, if the input contains a "batch_index", the function calculates the offset based on the current batch indices. It then updates the "batch_index" by adding new indices for the repeated samples, ensuring that each set of repeated samples has a unique batch index.

Finally, the function returns a tuple containing the modified samples dictionary.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the input samples contain the expected keys ("samples", "noise_mask", and "batch_index") to avoid potential errors during execution. The function assumes that the shapes of the arrays are compatible for the operations performed.

**Output Example**: If the input samples dictionary is as follows:
{
    "samples": tensor([[1, 2], [3, 4]]),
    "noise_mask": tensor([[1], [0]]),
    "batch_index": [0, 1]
}
and the amount is set to 2, the output would resemble:
(
{
    "samples": tensor([[1, 2], [3, 4], [1, 2], [3, 4]]),
    "noise_mask": tensor([[1], [0], [1], [0]]),
    "batch_index": [0, 1, 2, 3]
}
)
***
## ClassDef LatentUpscale
**LatentUpscale**: The function of LatentUpscale is to upscale latent samples using specified methods and dimensions.

**attributes**: The attributes of this Class.
· upscale_methods: A list of available methods for upscaling images, including "nearest-exact", "bilinear", "area", "bicubic", and "bislerp".
· crop_methods: A list of cropping options, including "disabled" and "center".
· INPUT_TYPES: A class method that defines the required input types for the upscaling process.
· RETURN_TYPES: A tuple indicating the type of output returned by the upscale method, which is "LATENT".
· FUNCTION: A string that specifies the name of the method to be called for processing, which is "upscale".
· CATEGORY: A string that categorizes this class under "latent".

**Code Description**: The LatentUpscale class is designed to handle the upscaling of latent samples, which are typically used in machine learning and image processing tasks. The class provides a set of predefined methods for upscaling images, allowing users to choose the most suitable method for their needs. The INPUT_TYPES class method specifies the required inputs for the upscale function, including the latent samples, the desired upscale method, and the target dimensions (width and height). It also allows for cropping options. The upscale method itself performs the actual upscaling operation. If both width and height are set to zero, it retains the original samples. If only one dimension is specified, it calculates the other dimension based on the aspect ratio of the original samples. The method ensures that the dimensions are at least 64 pixels. The upscaled samples are generated using a utility function that applies the chosen upscale method and cropping option.

**Note**: When using the LatentUpscale class, ensure that the input dimensions do not exceed the defined maximum resolution. Additionally, be aware that setting both width and height to zero will result in no changes to the samples.

**Output Example**: A possible appearance of the code's return value could be a dictionary containing the upscaled samples, structured as follows:
{
    "samples": <upscaled_image_array>
} 
Where <upscaled_image_array> represents the processed image data after applying the specified upscaling method and dimensions.
### FunctionDef INPUT_TYPES(s)
**INPUT_TYPES**: The function of INPUT_TYPES is to define and return the required input types for a specific operation related to latent upscaling.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· parameter1: s - An instance of a class that contains methods and properties related to the upscale operation, such as available upscale methods and crop methods.

**Code Description**: The INPUT_TYPES function constructs a dictionary that specifies the required input types for a latent upscaling operation. The returned dictionary contains a single key "required", which maps to another dictionary detailing the necessary inputs. 

The "samples" key expects a tuple containing the string "LATENT", indicating that the input should be of the latent type. The "upscale_method" key retrieves the available upscale methods from the instance `s` and expects a tuple of these methods. 

The "width" and "height" keys are both defined to accept integer values. Each of these keys has a dictionary associated with them that specifies additional constraints: 
- "default" is set to 512, which indicates the default value if none is provided.
- "min" is set to 0, establishing the minimum allowable value.
- "max" is set to MAX_RESOLUTION, which should be defined elsewhere in the code, indicating the maximum allowable resolution.
- "step" is set to 8, which defines the increment steps allowed for these dimensions.

Lastly, the "crop" key expects a tuple of crop methods retrieved from the instance `s`. This structure ensures that the function provides a clear specification of the expected input types and their constraints, facilitating validation and processing of the input data.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the `s` parameter is properly instantiated with the necessary methods and properties before calling this function, as it relies on `s.upscale_methods` and `s.crop_methods` to define the available options.

**Output Example**: A possible appearance of the code's return value could be:
{
    "required": {
        "samples": ("LATENT",),
        "upscale_method": ("method1", "method2", "method3"),
        "width": ("INT", {"default": 512, "min": 0, "max": 2048, "step": 8}),
        "height": ("INT", {"default": 512, "min": 0, "max": 2048, "step": 8}),

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· samples: A dictionary containing a tensor of shape (N, C, H, W) representing a batch of images, where N is the number of samples, C is the number of channels, H is the height, and W is the width.  
· upscale_method: A string indicating the method used for upscaling, which can be "bislerp", "lanczos", or any other valid mode supported by PyTorch's interpolation function.  
· width: An integer specifying the target width for the resized images.  
· height: An integer specifying the target height for the resized images.  
· crop: A string that determines the cropping strategy; it can be "center" to crop the center of the image or any other value to skip cropping.

**Code Description**: The upscale function begins by checking the provided width and height parameters. If both are set to zero, it retains the original samples without any modifications. If either width or height is specified, it creates a copy of the samples to avoid altering the original data.

When only one of the dimensions (width or height) is provided as zero, the function calculates the missing dimension based on the aspect ratio of the original samples. It ensures that both dimensions are at least 64 pixels. The function then calls the common_upscale function from the ldm_patched.modules.utils module, passing the modified samples along with the calculated width and height, the specified upscale_method, and the crop parameter.

The common_upscale function is responsible for the actual resizing of the images. It handles the cropping if the crop parameter is set to "center" and applies the appropriate upscaling method based on the upscale_method parameter. This modular design allows the upscale function to focus on preparing the input data while delegating the resizing logic to common_upscale.

The upscale function returns a tuple containing the processed samples, which can then be used for further operations in the image processing workflow.

**Note**: It is essential to ensure that the input tensor (samples) is in the correct shape and data type before calling the upscale function. The function assumes that the input tensor is a 4-dimensional tensor representing a batch of images.

**Output Example**: Given an input tensor of shape (1, 3, 64, 64) representing a single image with 3 color channels and a size of 64x64, calling upscale with width=128, height=128, upscale_method="lanczos", and crop="center" would return a tuple containing a tensor of shape (1, 3, 128, 128) with the resized image data.

**Code Description**: The LatentUpscaleBy class is designed to facilitate the upscaling of latent samples in a structured manner. It contains a class-level attribute, `upscale_methods`, which defines the various methods available for upscaling. The class provides a class method `INPUT_TYPES` that specifies the required input types for the upscaling operation. This method returns a dictionary indicating that the inputs must include `samples` of type "LATENT", an `upscale_method` selected from the predefined list, and a `scale_by` parameter of type "FLOAT" with a default value of 1.5, constrained between 0.01 and 8.0 with a step of 0.01.

The class also defines a `RETURN_TYPES` attribute, indicating that the output of the upscaling operation will be of type "LATENT". The `FUNCTION` attribute specifies that the main function of the class is named "upscale". 

The core functionality is implemented in the `upscale` method, which takes three parameters: `samples`, `upscale_method`, and `scale_by`. Inside this method, a copy of the input samples is created. The new dimensions for the upscaled samples are calculated by multiplying the original width and height by the `scale_by` factor and rounding the results. The method then calls an external utility function, `common_upscale`, to perform the actual upscaling operation using the specified method. Finally, the method returns a tuple containing the upscaled samples.

**Note**: When using this class, ensure that the `scale_by` parameter is within the specified range to avoid unexpected behavior. The choice of `upscale_method` will affect the quality and characteristics of the upscaled output.

**Output Example**: An example of the return value from the `upscale` method might look like this:
```python
{
    "samples": <upscaled_latent_tensor>
}
``` 
Where `<upscaled_latent_tensor>` represents the tensor containing the upscaled latent samples.

The "samples" key expects a tuple containing the string "LATENT", indicating that the input should be of the latent type. The "upscale_method" key expects a tuple that includes the upscale methods available in the object s, which is passed as a parameter to the function. This allows for dynamic retrieval of the upscale methods based on the current state of the object.

The "scale_by" key expects a tuple with a string "FLOAT" and a dictionary that defines the properties of the floating-point number. This dictionary specifies a default value of 1.5, a minimum value of 0.01, a maximum value of 8.0, and a step increment of 0.01. This structure ensures that the scaling factor is a float within the specified range, allowing for precise control over the upscaling process.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the parameter s passed to the function contains a valid attribute named upscale_methods. Additionally, the function is designed to enforce input validation by clearly defining the expected types and constraints for each parameter.

**Output Example**: A possible appearance of the code's return value could be:
{
    "required": {
        "samples": ("LATENT",),
        "upscale_method": ("method1", "method2", "method3"),

· scale_by: A float that specifies the scaling factor by which the original dimensions of the images will be multiplied to determine the new dimensions.

**Code Description**: The upscale function begins by creating a copy of the input samples to avoid modifying the original data. It then calculates the new width and height for the images by multiplying the original dimensions by the scale_by factor and rounding the results to the nearest integer. 

Next, the function calls the common_upscale function from the ldm_patched.modules.utils module, passing the original samples, the newly calculated width and height, the specified upscale_method, and a cropping strategy set to "disabled". The common_upscale function is responsible for resizing the images according to the specified parameters and handles various interpolation methods.

Finally, the upscale function returns a tuple containing the modified samples dictionary, which now includes the upscaled images. This function is typically used in image processing workflows where resizing images is necessary before further operations, ensuring that the images conform to the required dimensions.

The upscale function is part of a larger class structure that includes other upscaling methods, allowing for a modular approach to image processing. By utilizing common_upscale, it ensures consistency in how images are resized across different methods.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the input tensor (samples["samples"]) is in the correct shape and data type before calling the upscale function. The function assumes that the input tensor is a 4-dimensional tensor representing a batch of images.

**Output Example**: Given an input tensor of shape (1, 3, 4, 4) representing a single image with 3 color channels and a size of 4x4, calling upscale with upscale_method="bislerp" and scale_by=2 would return a tuple containing a dictionary with a tensor of shape (1, 3, 8, 8) containing the resized image data.

The class also defines a `RETURN_TYPES` attribute indicating that the output will be of type "LATENT".

The core functionality is encapsulated in the `rotate` method. This method takes in the `samples` and the desired `rotation` as arguments. It creates a copy of the input samples to avoid modifying the original data. Based on the specified rotation, it determines how many times to rotate the samples by 90 degrees using the `torch.rot90` function. The rotation is applied to the last two dimensions of the tensor representing the samples. Finally, the method returns a tuple containing the modified samples.

**Note**: When using this class, ensure that the input samples are in the correct format and that the rotation parameter is one of the specified options. The method modifies the samples in a way that is consistent with tensor operations in PyTorch.

**Output Example**: An example of the output when applying a 90-degree rotation to a sample could look like this:  
```python
{
    "samples": tensor([[...], [...], ...])  # The tensor structure will reflect the rotated samples.
}
```
### FunctionDef INPUT_TYPES(s)
**INPUT_TYPES**: The function of INPUT_TYPES is to define and return the required input types for a specific operation involving latent samples and rotation options.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· parameter1: s - This parameter is not utilized within the function body and serves no purpose in the current implementation.

**Code Description**: The INPUT_TYPES function constructs a dictionary that specifies the required input types for a process that involves latent samples and rotation angles. The function returns a dictionary with a single key "required". Under this key, there are two entries: "samples" and "rotation". The "samples" entry is associated with a tuple containing a single string "LATENT", indicating that the function expects latent samples as input. The "rotation" entry is associated with a tuple that contains a list of strings, which represent the valid rotation options: "none", "90 degrees", "180 degrees", and "270 degrees". This structure ensures that the function clearly communicates the expected types of inputs, facilitating validation and error-checking in the broader context where this function is utilized.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the inputs provided to the function conform to the specified types and formats. The "samples" must be of type "LATENT", and the "rotation" must be one of the defined string options. Any deviation from these expected inputs may lead to errors or unexpected behavior in the application.

**Output Example**: An example of the return value of the INPUT_TYPES function would be:
{
    "required": {
        "samples": ("LATENT",),
        "rotation": (["none", "90 degrees", "180 degrees", "270 degrees"],)
    }
}
***
### FunctionDef rotate(self, samples, rotation)
**rotate**: The function of rotate is to rotate a given set of samples by a specified angle.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· samples: A dictionary containing the key "samples", which holds the tensor data to be rotated.
· rotation: A string indicating the angle of rotation, which can be "90", "180", or "270".

**Code Description**: The rotate function begins by creating a copy of the input samples to avoid modifying the original data. It initializes a variable `rotate_by` to determine the number of 90-degree rotations needed based on the provided rotation string. The function checks the value of the rotation parameter; if it starts with "90", `rotate_by` is set to 1, indicating a 90-degree rotation. If it starts with "180", `rotate_by` is set to 2 for a 180-degree rotation, and if it starts with "270", `rotate_by` is set to 3 for a 270-degree rotation. 

The core operation of the function uses the PyTorch library's `torch.rot90` method to perform the rotation. It rotates the tensor found in the "samples" key of the input dictionary `samples` by `k` times 90 degrees, where `k` is the value of `rotate_by`. The dimensions specified for the rotation are [3, 2], which correspond to the last two dimensions of the tensor, typically representing height and width in image data. Finally, the function returns a tuple containing the modified dictionary `s`, which now includes the rotated samples.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the input tensor has at least four dimensions, as the rotation is applied to the last two dimensions. The function does not handle cases where the rotation string is invalid or does not match the expected values.

**Output Example**: If the input samples contain a tensor of shape (1, 3, 4, 4) representing a batch of one image with three color channels and a 4x4 pixel size, and the rotation parameter is "90", the output will be a tuple containing a dictionary with the rotated tensor, which will have the shape (1, 3, 4, 4) but with the pixel values rotated 90 degrees clockwise.

· CATEGORY: Categorizes the functionality of the class within the project.

**Code Description**: The LatentFlip class is designed to facilitate the transformation of latent samples by flipping them along specified axes. It contains a class method INPUT_TYPES that outlines the required inputs for the flipping operation. The inputs include "samples," which is expected to be of type "LATENT," and "flip_method," which specifies the axis along which the samples should be flipped. The flip_method can take two values: "x-axis: vertically" or "y-axis: horizontally." 

The class also defines RETURN_TYPES, which indicates that the output will be of type "LATENT." The FUNCTION attribute specifies that the core functionality of the class is encapsulated in the "flip" method. 

The flip method itself takes two parameters: samples and flip_method. It creates a copy of the input samples to avoid modifying the original data. Based on the specified flip_method, the method uses the PyTorch library's flip function to perform the flipping operation. If the flip_method starts with "x," it flips the samples along the second dimension (height), while if it starts with "y," it flips along the third dimension (width). The method then returns the modified samples as a tuple.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the input samples are in the correct format and that the flip_method is specified accurately to avoid errors during execution. The class relies on the PyTorch library, so it must be imported and available in the environment where this class is used.

**Output Example**: An example of the return value after executing the flip method could be a tuple containing a dictionary with the key "samples" pointing to a tensor that has been flipped according to the specified method. For instance, if the input tensor had a shape of (1, 3, 64, 64) and the flip_method was "x-axis: vertically," the output might look like:
```python
({"samples": tensor([[[...flipped data...]]])},)
```
### FunctionDef INPUT_TYPES(s)
**INPUT_TYPES**: The function of INPUT_TYPES is to define and return the required input types for a specific operation involving latent samples and flip methods.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· parameter1: s - This parameter is not utilized within the function body and serves as a placeholder.

**Code Description**: The INPUT_TYPES function is designed to return a dictionary that specifies the required input types for a particular operation. The returned dictionary contains a single key, "required", which maps to another dictionary. This inner dictionary defines two required inputs: "samples" and "flip_method". 

- The "samples" key is associated with a tuple containing a single string "LATENT", indicating that the function expects latent samples as input.
- The "flip_method" key is associated with a tuple that contains a list of two string options: "x-axis: vertically" and "y-axis: horizontally". This indicates that the function allows the user to specify a method for flipping the samples along either the x-axis or the y-axis.

The structure of the returned dictionary ensures that the inputs are clearly defined and that the user is aware of the expected types and options available for each input.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the inputs provided to the function conform to the specified types and options. The "samples" input must be of type "LATENT", and the "flip_method" input must be one of the specified string options.

**Output Example**: An example of the return value from the INPUT_TYPES function would be:
{
    "required": {
        "samples": ("LATENT",),
        "flip_method": (["x-axis: vertically", "y-axis: horizontally"],)
    }
}
***
### FunctionDef flip(self, samples, flip_method)
**flip**: The function of flip is to apply a specified flipping transformation to the samples along the x or y axis.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· samples: A dictionary containing the key "samples", which holds a tensor of data to be flipped.
· flip_method: A string that indicates the direction of the flip; it should start with either "x" for flipping along the x-axis or "y" for flipping along the y-axis.

**Code Description**: The flip function begins by creating a copy of the input samples to avoid modifying the original data. It checks the value of the flip_method parameter to determine the direction of the flip. If flip_method starts with "x", the function uses the PyTorch `torch.flip` method to flip the tensor along the second dimension (index 2), which corresponds to the x-axis. If flip_method starts with "y", it flips the tensor along the third dimension (index 3), corresponding to the y-axis. The modified samples are then stored back in the copied dictionary under the key "samples". Finally, the function returns a tuple containing the modified samples dictionary.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the samples tensor has at least four dimensions for the flipping operations to be valid. Additionally, the flip_method should be carefully constructed to avoid unexpected behavior; it must start with either "x" or "y".

**Output Example**: If the input samples dictionary contains a tensor of shape (1, 3, 4, 4) and the flip_method is "x", the output will be a tuple containing a dictionary with the flipped tensor along the x-axis, resulting in a tensor of the same shape but with the x-axis values reversed. For instance, if the original tensor was:
```
[[[[1, 2, 3, 4],
  [5, 6, 7, 8],
  [9, 10, 11, 12],
  [13, 14, 15, 16]]]]]
```
The output after flipping along the x-axis would be:
```
[[[[4, 3, 2, 1],
  [8, 7, 6, 5],
  [12, 11, 10, 9],
  [16, 15, 14, 13]]]]]

## ClassDef LatentComposite
**LatentComposite**: The function of LatentComposite is to composite latent samples based on specified coordinates and a feathering effect.

**attributes**: The attributes of this Class.
· INPUT_TYPES: Defines the required input types for the composite function, including latent samples and integer parameters for positioning and feathering.
· RETURN_TYPES: Specifies the return type of the composite function, which is a latent sample.
· FUNCTION: The name of the function that performs the compositing operation, which is "composite".
· CATEGORY: Indicates the category of the operation, which is "latent".

**Code Description**: The LatentComposite class provides a method for compositing two sets of latent samples. The INPUT_TYPES class method specifies the required inputs: `samples_to` and `samples_from`, which are both expected to be of type "LATENT", and three integer parameters `x`, `y`, and `feather` that control the positioning and feathering effect of the composite operation. The `x` and `y` parameters determine the top-left corner of where the `samples_from` will be placed on the `samples_to`, while `feather` controls the blending effect at the edges of the composite.

The composite method first normalizes the `x`, `y`, and `feather` values by dividing them by 8. It then creates a copy of `samples_to` to hold the output. If the `feather` parameter is set to 0, the method directly places `samples_from` into the specified location of `samples_to`. If `feather` is greater than 0, the method applies a blending effect using a mask that gradually transitions between the two sample sets, creating a smoother composite.

The resulting composite is stored in `samples_out`, which is returned as a tuple containing the updated latent sample.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the dimensions of `samples_from` do not exceed those of `samples_to` after applying the offsets defined by `x` and `y`. Additionally, the feathering effect requires careful consideration of the `feather` parameter to achieve the desired blending effect without artifacts.

**Output Example**: A possible appearance of the code's return value could be a dictionary structure containing the composited latent samples, such as:
{
  "samples": tensor([[...], [...], ...])  # A tensor representing the composited latent samples
}
### FunctionDef INPUT_TYPES(s)
**INPUT_TYPES**: The function of INPUT_TYPES is to define and return the required input types for a specific operation involving latent samples.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· s: This parameter is typically used to represent the state or context in which the function is called, although it is not utilized within the function body.

**Code Description**: The INPUT_TYPES function constructs and returns a dictionary that specifies the required input types for a particular process. The dictionary contains a single key, "required", which maps to another dictionary detailing the expected inputs. Each input is associated with a specific type and, where applicable, additional constraints.

The inputs defined in the returned dictionary are as follows:
- "samples_to": This input expects a value of type "LATENT", indicating that it should be a latent representation.
- "samples_from": Similar to "samples_to", this input also requires a value of type "LATENT".
- "x": This input is of type "INT" and has constraints defined by a dictionary that specifies a default value of 0, a minimum value of 0, a maximum value defined by the constant MAX_RESOLUTION, and a step increment of 8.
- "y": Like "x", this input is also of type "INT" with the same constraints.
- "feather": This input is again of type "INT" and follows the same constraints as "x" and "y".

The use of these specific types and constraints ensures that the inputs adhere to expected formats and ranges, which is crucial for the proper functioning of the underlying processes that utilize these inputs.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the values provided for "x", "y", and "feather" fall within the defined constraints to avoid errors during execution. The MAX_RESOLUTION constant should be defined elsewhere in the codebase to ensure proper functionality.

**Output Example**: A possible appearance of the code's return value could be:
{
    "required": {
        "samples_to": ("LATENT",),
        "samples_from": ("LATENT",),
        "x": ("INT", {"default": 0, "min": 0, "max": 1024, "step": 8}),
        "y": ("INT", {"default": 0, "min": 0, "max": 1024, "step": 8}),
        "feather": ("INT", {"default": 0, "min": 0, "max": 1024, "step": 8}),

### FunctionDef composite(self, samples_to, samples_from, x, y, composite_method, feather)
**composite**: The function of composite is to blend two sets of samples together, applying a feathering effect if specified.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· samples_to: A dictionary containing the target samples to which the blending will be applied. It must include a key "samples" that holds the tensor of samples.
· samples_from: A dictionary containing the source samples that will be blended into the target samples. It must also include a key "samples" that holds the tensor of samples.
· x: An integer representing the x-coordinate offset for the blending operation.
· y: An integer representing the y-coordinate offset for the blending operation.
· composite_method: A string that specifies the method of compositing. The default value is "normal".
· feather: An integer that determines the feathering effect applied to the edges of the blended samples. The default value is 0.

**Code Description**: The composite function begins by scaling down the x and y coordinates, as well as the feathering value, by a factor of 8. It then creates a copy of the samples_to dictionary and clones its "samples" tensor into a new variable `s`. The function extracts the "samples" tensors from both samples_to and samples_from for processing.

If the feathering value is set to 0, the function directly replaces the corresponding region in the target samples with the source samples, ensuring that the dimensions do not exceed the bounds of the target tensor. 

If feathering is enabled (feather > 0), the function first slices the source samples to match the dimensions of the target samples. It then creates a mask tensor initialized to ones, which will be used to apply a gradual blending effect at the edges. The mask is modified in a loop that iterates over the range of the feathering value, adjusting the mask values based on the proximity to the edges of the blending area.

The final blended output is computed by combining the source samples and the original target samples using the mask and its complement (rev_mask). The blended samples are then stored back into the samples_out dictionary under the key "samples". The function concludes by returning the modified samples_out dictionary as a tuple.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the dimensions of the source and target samples are compatible for blending. The feathering effect will create a smoother transition at the edges, but it requires careful handling of the mask to avoid artifacts in the output.

**Output Example**: A possible return value of the function could be a dictionary structured as follows:
{
    "samples": tensor_of_blended_samples
} 
where tensor_of_blended_samples is a tensor that contains the blended result of the input samples.

## ClassDef LatentBlend
**LatentBlend**: The function of LatentBlend is to blend two latent samples based on a specified blend factor and mode.

**attributes**: The attributes of this Class.
· INPUT_TYPES: A class method that defines the required input types for the blending operation, including two latent samples and a blend factor.  
· RETURN_TYPES: Specifies the type of output returned by the blend function, which is a latent sample.  
· FUNCTION: The name of the function that performs the blending operation, which is "blend".  
· CATEGORY: Indicates the category of the class, which is "_for_testing".  

**Code Description**: The LatentBlend class is designed to facilitate the blending of two latent samples using a specified blend factor and blending mode. The class includes a class method INPUT_TYPES that outlines the necessary inputs for the blending process. It requires two latent samples (samples1 and samples2) and a blend factor, which is a floating-point number with a default value of 0.5, a minimum value of 0, a maximum value of 1, and a step of 0.01. The RETURN_TYPES attribute indicates that the output of the blending operation will also be a latent sample.

The primary method of the class is blend, which takes in two latent samples and a blend factor, along with an optional blend mode parameter that defaults to "normal". Inside the blend method, the samples are first copied to preserve the original data. If the shapes of the two samples do not match, the second sample is permuted and upscaled to match the dimensions of the first sample using bicubic interpolation. The blending operation is then performed based on the specified blend mode. In the case of the "normal" mode, the second sample is directly used for blending. The final blended output is computed by applying the blend factor to the first sample and combining it with the second sample. The result is stored in the samples_out dictionary under the key "samples", which is then returned as a tuple.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the input latent samples are compatible in terms of shape, as the blending operation requires them to be of the same dimensions. The class currently supports only the "normal" blend mode, and any unsupported mode will raise a ValueError.

**Output Example**: An example of the output returned by the blend method could look like this:
{
  "samples": array([[...], [...], ...])  # A numpy array representing the blended latent sample.
}
### FunctionDef INPUT_TYPES(s)

· blend_factor: This parameter is a floating-point number, indicated by the type "FLOAT". It has additional constraints including a default value of 0.5, a minimum value of 0, a maximum value of 1, and a step increment of 0.01.

**Code Description**: The INPUT_TYPES function returns a dictionary that specifies the required input types for a specific operation. The dictionary contains a key "required" which maps to another dictionary detailing the expected parameters. The parameters include "samples1" and "samples2", both of which are required to be of the type "LATENT". This indicates that the function is designed to work with latent variables, which are typically used in machine learning models to represent compressed information. The "blend_factor" parameter is of type "FLOAT" and is used to control the blending operation. It is defined with a default value of 0.5, allowing for a midpoint blend, and is constrained to values between 0 and 1, with a precision of 0.01. This setup ensures that users can only input valid and meaningful values for blending.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the inputs provided for "samples1" and "samples2" are indeed latent representations, as the function is specifically designed to handle these types. Additionally, when setting the "blend_factor", users should be mindful of the defined range and step to avoid errors.

**Output Example**: A possible appearance of the code's return value could be:
{
    "required": {
        "samples1": ("LATENT",),
        "samples2": ("LATENT",),
        "blend_factor": ("FLOAT", {

· samples1: A dictionary containing the first set of image samples, where the key "samples" holds the actual image data in a tensor format.  
· samples2: A dictionary containing the second set of image samples, structured similarly to samples1.  
· blend_factor: A float value that determines the weight of the first sample in the blending process, with a range typically between 0 and 1.  
· blend_mode: A string that specifies the blending mode to be applied; currently, only "normal" is supported.

**Code Description**: The blend function begins by creating a copy of the first sample set (samples1) to preserve its original structure for the output. It extracts the actual image data from both samples1 and samples2 using the key "samples". 

Next, the function checks if the shapes of the two sample tensors are compatible. If they differ, it permutes the dimensions of samples2 to align with the expected format and then uses the common_upscale function to resize samples2 to match the height and width of samples1. This resizing is performed using bicubic interpolation, with the cropping strategy set to 'center' to ensure that the most relevant part of the image is retained.

Once the samples are aligned in shape, the function calls the blend_mode function, passing in the two sets of samples along with the specified blend_mode. The blend_mode function applies the blending operation according to the defined mode, which in this case is "normal". 

The blended output is then calculated by combining samples1 and the result from blend_mode, weighted by the blend_factor. This results in a final blended image that reflects the desired proportions of the two input samples. The blended image is then stored back into the output dictionary under the key "samples".

Finally, the function returns a tuple containing the output dictionary, which includes the blended image data.

**Note**: It is crucial to ensure that the blend_mode function is only called with supported modes, as currently, only "normal" is implemented. Additionally, the input samples must be structured correctly, with the image data accessible via the "samples" key.

**Output Example**: If samples1 contains an image tensor of shape (1, 3, 256, 256) and samples2 contains another image tensor of the same shape, calling blend(samples1, samples2, 0.5, "normal") would return a dictionary with the blended image tensor, where the output tensor represents a blend of the two input images based on the specified blend factor.
***
### FunctionDef blend_mode(self, img1, img2, mode)
**blend_mode**: The function of blend_mode is to apply a specified blending mode to two images.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· img1: The first image to be blended, typically represented as an array or tensor.
· img2: The second image to be blended with the first image, also represented as an array or tensor.
· mode: A string that specifies the blending mode to be applied. Currently, only "normal" is supported.

**Code Description**: The blend_mode function takes two images and a blending mode as input. If the specified mode is "normal", the function simply returns the second image (img2). If any other mode is provided, the function raises a ValueError indicating that the blend mode is unsupported. This function is called within the blend function, which is responsible for blending two sets of samples based on a specified blend factor and mode. The blend function first ensures that the two input samples have compatible shapes, potentially resizing the second sample to match the first. It then calls blend_mode to obtain the blended result based on the specified mode. The final output is a combination of the first sample and the blended result, weighted by the blend factor.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the blend_mode function is only called with supported modes. Currently, only "normal" is implemented, and any other mode will result in an error.

**Output Example**: If img1 is an array representing an image and img2 is another array representing a different image, calling blend_mode(img1, img2, "normal") would return img2 as the output.

## ClassDef LatentCrop
**LatentCrop**: The function of LatentCrop is to crop latent samples based on specified dimensions and coordinates.

**attributes**: The attributes of this Class.
· INPUT_TYPES: Defines the required input types for the cropping operation, including samples, width, height, x, and y coordinates.
· RETURN_TYPES: Specifies the type of output returned by the crop function, which is a latent sample.
· FUNCTION: The name of the function that performs the cropping operation, which is "crop".
· CATEGORY: Indicates the category under which this class is organized, which is "latent/transform".

**Code Description**: The LatentCrop class is designed to perform cropping operations on latent samples, which are typically multi-dimensional arrays representing data in a compressed form. The class contains a class method `INPUT_TYPES` that outlines the required inputs for the cropping operation. These inputs include:
- `samples`: A latent representation of the data to be cropped.
- `width`: The desired width of the cropped output, with constraints on its minimum and maximum values.
- `height`: The desired height of the cropped output, similarly constrained.
- `x`: The x-coordinate from which to start the crop.
- `y`: The y-coordinate from which to start the crop.

The `crop` method takes these parameters and processes the latent samples. It first creates a copy of the input samples to avoid modifying the original data. The x and y coordinates are adjusted by dividing them by 8, which is likely due to the internal representation of the data being downsampled. The method then ensures that the cropping coordinates do not exceed the bounds of the sample dimensions, applying a minimum size constraint of 64 pixels.

The new height and width for the crop are also calculated by dividing the input dimensions by 8. The method then extracts the relevant portion of the samples based on the calculated coordinates and dimensions, returning the cropped samples encapsulated in a dictionary.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the input dimensions for width and height are within the specified limits, and that the x and y coordinates do not exceed the dimensions of the input samples after adjustment. The cropping operation is performed on downscaled coordinates, so users should be aware of this when specifying their input values.

**Output Example**: A possible appearance of the code's return value could be:
{
  'samples': array([[[...], [...], ...], [[...], [...], ...], ...])
} 
This output represents the cropped latent samples as a multi-dimensional array, where the dimensions correspond to the specified height and width.
### FunctionDef INPUT_TYPES(s)
**INPUT_TYPES**: The function of INPUT_TYPES is to define the required input types and their constraints for a specific operation in the code.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· s: This parameter is typically a placeholder for the state or context in which the function is called, but it is not utilized within the function itself.

**Code Description**: The INPUT_TYPES function returns a dictionary that specifies the required input types for a particular operation. The dictionary contains a single key, "required", which maps to another dictionary detailing the expected inputs. Each input is defined by its name and a tuple that specifies its type and additional constraints. 

The inputs defined are as follows:
- "samples": This input is expected to be of type "LATENT".
- "width": This input is an integer ("INT") with a default value of 512. It has constraints that specify a minimum value of 64, a maximum value defined by the constant MAX_RESOLUTION, and a step increment of 8.
- "height": Similar to "width", this input is also an integer with the same constraints and default value.
- "x": This input represents the x-coordinate and is defined as an integer with a default value of 0. It has a minimum value of 0, a maximum value of MAX_RESOLUTION, and a step increment of 8.
- "y": This input represents the y-coordinate and is defined in the same manner as "x", with a default value of 0 and similar constraints.

The function effectively enforces the structure and constraints of the inputs required for the operation, ensuring that the values provided by the user adhere to the specified types and limits.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the values provided for width, height, x, and y fall within the defined ranges to avoid errors during execution. The MAX_RESOLUTION constant should be defined elsewhere in the code to ensure proper functionality.

**Output Example**: A possible appearance of the code's return value could be:
{
    "required": {
        "samples": ("LATENT",),
        "width": ("INT", {"default": 512, "min": 64, "max": 1024, "step": 8}),
        "height": ("INT", {"default": 512, "min": 64, "max": 1024, "step": 8}),
        "x": ("INT", {"default": 0, "min": 0, "max": 1024, "step": 8}),
        "y": ("INT", {"default": 0, "min": 0, "max": 1024, "step": 8}),
    }
}

### FunctionDef crop(self, samples, width, height, x, y)
**crop**: The function of crop is to extract a specific region from a set of samples based on given dimensions and coordinates.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· samples: A dictionary containing a key 'samples' which holds a tensor of image data.
· width: The width of the region to be cropped from the samples.
· height: The height of the region to be cropped from the samples.
· x: The x-coordinate of the top-left corner of the cropping region.
· y: The y-coordinate of the top-left corner of the cropping region.

**Code Description**: The crop function begins by creating a copy of the input samples to avoid modifying the original data. It then extracts the tensor of samples from the dictionary. The x and y coordinates are adjusted by dividing them by 8, which is likely a scaling factor related to the resolution of the samples. 

Next, the function ensures that the x and y coordinates do not exceed the bounds of the sample dimensions, specifically ensuring that they are at least 8 pixels away from the edges to maintain a minimum cropping size. If the adjusted x or y coordinates exceed the allowable limits, they are set to the maximum permissible values.

The function then calculates the new width and height for the cropping region, also divided by 8. It determines the ending coordinates (to_x and to_y) for the crop based on the new dimensions and the starting coordinates. Finally, it updates the 'samples' key in the copied dictionary with the cropped region of the original samples, which is defined by the slicing operation using the calculated coordinates. The function returns a tuple containing the modified samples dictionary.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the input dimensions (width and height) are appropriate for the cropping operation, and that the x and y coordinates are within valid ranges to avoid errors during slicing.

**Output Example**: An example of the return value could be a dictionary structured as follows:
{
  'samples': tensor([[...], [...], ...])  # A tensor containing the cropped image data
}
***
## ClassDef SetLatentNoiseMask
**SetLatentNoiseMask**: The function of SetLatentNoiseMask is to apply a noise mask to latent samples.

**attributes**: The attributes of this Class.
· INPUT_TYPES: Specifies the required input types for the function, which includes "samples" of type "LATENT" and "mask" of type "MASK".
· RETURN_TYPES: Indicates the return type of the function, which is "LATENT".
· FUNCTION: The name of the function that will be executed, which is "set_mask".
· CATEGORY: Defines the category under which this class is organized, specifically "latent/inpaint".

**Code Description**: The SetLatentNoiseMask class is designed to manipulate latent samples by applying a noise mask. The class contains a class method INPUT_TYPES that defines the necessary inputs for the operation. It requires two parameters: "samples", which are expected to be of type LATENT, and "mask", which is of type MASK. The class also specifies that the output will be of type LATENT.

The core functionality is encapsulated in the method set_mask, which takes two arguments: samples and mask. Within this method, a copy of the samples is created to avoid modifying the original data. The noise mask is then reshaped to match the dimensions required for integration with the latent samples. Specifically, the mask is reshaped to have a shape of (-1, 1, mask.shape[-2], mask.shape[-1]), ensuring that it can be appropriately applied to the latent samples. Finally, the modified samples, now including the noise mask, are returned as a tuple.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the dimensions of the mask are compatible with the latent samples to avoid runtime errors. The reshaping operation is crucial for the correct application of the mask.

**Output Example**: An example of the output from the set_mask function could look like this:
{
  "latent_data": {
    "noise_mask": [[[[0, 1], [1, 0]]]],  // Example mask applied to the latent data
    ...
  }
}
### FunctionDef INPUT_TYPES(s)
**INPUT_TYPES**: The function of INPUT_TYPES is to define the required input types for a specific operation involving latent samples and a mask.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· parameter1: s - This parameter is typically used to represent the state or context in which the function is called, although it is not utilized within the function itself.

**Code Description**: The INPUT_TYPES function returns a dictionary that specifies the required input types for a particular operation. The dictionary contains a single key, "required", which maps to another dictionary. This inner dictionary defines two required inputs: "samples" and "mask". The "samples" input is expected to be of the type "LATENT", indicating that it should contain latent representations, while the "mask" input is expected to be of the type "MASK", which suggests that it should be a masking tensor or similar structure. This structured return value is essential for ensuring that the correct types of data are provided when the function is invoked, thereby facilitating proper processing in subsequent operations.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the inputs provided to the function conform to the specified types ("LATENT" for samples and "MASK" for the mask) to avoid errors during execution.

**Output Example**: A possible appearance of the code's return value could be:
{
    "required": {
        "samples": ("LATENT",),
        "mask": ("MASK",)
    }
}
***
### FunctionDef set_mask(self, samples, mask)
**set_mask**: The function of set_mask is to apply a noise mask to a set of samples by reshaping the mask and adding it to the samples.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· samples: A dictionary-like object containing sample data to which the noise mask will be applied.  
· mask: A numpy array representing the noise mask that will be reshaped and added to the samples.

**Code Description**: The set_mask function takes two parameters: samples and mask. It begins by creating a copy of the samples to avoid modifying the original data. The mask is then reshaped to have four dimensions: the first dimension is inferred (using -1), the second dimension is set to 1, and the last two dimensions correspond to the height and width of the mask. This reshaped mask is then added to the copied samples under the key "noise_mask". Finally, the function returns a tuple containing the modified samples.

The reshaping of the mask is crucial as it ensures that the dimensions align correctly with the samples, allowing for proper integration of the noise mask into the sample data structure. The use of a tuple in the return statement indicates that the function is designed to return a single item, which is a common practice in functions that may be expanded in the future to return multiple values.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the dimensions of the mask are compatible with the expected dimensions of the samples. If the mask does not have the correct shape, it may lead to errors during the reshaping process or when accessing the "noise_mask" key in the samples.

**Output Example**: An example of the return value of the set_mask function could look like this:
```python
{
    "sample_data": [...],  # Original sample data
    "noise_mask": [[[0, 1], [1, 0]]]  # Reshaped noise mask
}
```

· last_step: An optional integer indicating the last step for sampling (default is None).
· force_full_denoise: A boolean flag to force full denoising during sampling (default is False).

**Code Description**: The common_ksampler function is designed to facilitate the generation of samples from a generative model by preparing the necessary inputs and invoking the appropriate sampling mechanism. It begins by extracting the latent image from the provided latent dictionary. If the disable_noise flag is set to True, it initializes a noise tensor filled with zeros that matches the size of the latent image. If noise is to be enabled, it calls the prepare_noise function from the ldm_patched.modules.sample module to generate random noise based on the latent image and the provided seed.

The function then checks for the presence of a noise mask in the latent dictionary, which can be used to selectively apply noise during the sampling process. A callback function is prepared using the prepare_callback function from ldm_patched.utils.latent_visualization, which facilitates the visualization of latent representations during the model processing.

Next, the function calls the sample method from ldm_patched.modules.sample, passing in all the necessary parameters, including the generated noise, the latent image, and the callback function. This method is responsible for executing the actual sampling process, utilizing the specified model and configuration.

Finally, the function returns a copy of the latent dictionary, now containing the generated samples under the key "samples". The common_ksampler function is called by other components in the project, such as the sample method in the KSampler and KSamplerAdvanced classes. These classes serve as higher-level interfaces for generating samples, demonstrating the common_ksampler's role as a core component in the sampling workflow.

**Note**: It is crucial to ensure that all input parameters, especially the latent dictionary and the seed, are structured correctly to avoid runtime errors during the sampling process. The use of the disable_noise flag and the noise mask should be configured based on the desired sampling behavior.

**Output Example**: A possible return value from the common_ksampler function could be a dictionary containing the generated samples, such as:
```
{
    "samples": tensor([[...], [...], ...]),
    "batch_index": [...],
    "noise_mask": [...]
}
```

The class defines a class method `INPUT_TYPES`, which specifies the required input types and their constraints. The method returns a dictionary that outlines the expected parameters, including their data types and any default values or limits. The `RETURN_TYPES` attribute indicates that the output of the sampling process will be of type "LATENT". The `FUNCTION` attribute specifies that the main operation of the class is encapsulated in the `sample` method. This method takes multiple parameters, including the model, seed, steps, configuration, sampler name, scheduler, positive and negative conditioning inputs, latent image, and a denoising factor. The method then calls a function `common_ksampler`, passing all the parameters to perform the actual sampling operation and return the resulting latent representation.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the input parameters adhere to the specified types and constraints to avoid runtime errors. The seed value can significantly affect the randomness of the output, and users should be aware of the implications of the denoise parameter on the quality of the generated latent representation.

**Output Example**: A possible return value from the `sample` method could be a tensor or array representing the latent space output, which may look like:
```
array([[0.123, 0.456, 0.789],

**Code Description**: The sample function serves as a wrapper to invoke the common_ksampler function, which is responsible for generating samples from a generative model. It takes multiple parameters that define the behavior of the sampling process, including the model, random seed, number of steps, configuration, sampler name, scheduler, and conditioning inputs (both positive and negative). 

Upon execution, the sample function calls the common_ksampler function, passing all the received parameters directly to it. The common_ksampler function then processes these inputs to generate samples based on the specified generative model. This function is integral to the sampling workflow, as it encapsulates the logic required to prepare the necessary inputs, manage noise, and execute the sampling process.

The sample function does not perform any additional logic or transformations on the parameters; its primary role is to facilitate the invocation of common_ksampler with the appropriate arguments. This design allows for a clean and modular approach to sampling, where the sample function acts as a high-level interface while delegating the core functionality to common_ksampler.

**Note**: It is essential to ensure that all input parameters are correctly structured and valid to avoid runtime errors during the sampling process. The denoise parameter should be set according to the desired level of denoising in the generated samples.

The sample method executes the sampling operation based on the provided parameters. It includes logic to handle noise settings and denoising processes. If the return_with_leftover_noise parameter is set to "enable", the method will allow for partial denoising; otherwise, it will enforce full denoising. The method also checks the add_noise parameter to determine whether to disable noise addition entirely.

The actual sampling is performed by calling the common_ksampler function, which takes all the defined parameters and executes the sampling operation accordingly.

**Note**: Users should ensure that the parameters provided to the sample method are within the specified ranges to avoid errors. Additionally, understanding the implications of noise settings and conditioning inputs is crucial for achieving the desired sampling results.

**Output Example**: A possible return value from the sample method could be a latent representation of the processed data, which may appear as a multi-dimensional array or tensor structure, depending on the specific implementation of the common_ksampler function.

### FunctionDef INPUT_TYPES(s)
**INPUT_TYPES**: The function of INPUT_TYPES is to retrieve a list of image files from the current input directory and return it in a structured format.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· s: This parameter is not utilized within the function body.

**Code Description**: The INPUT_TYPES function serves as a utility to gather and format the available image files from a designated input directory. It begins by calling the get_input_directory function from the ldm_patched.utils.path_utils module, which returns the path to the current input directory. This path is essential for locating the files that the application will process.

Once the input directory path is obtained, the function proceeds to list all files within that directory. It uses the os.listdir method to retrieve the contents of the directory and filters this list to include only files (excluding directories) by utilizing os.path.isfile in conjunction with os.path.join to ensure the correct file path is constructed. The resulting list of files is then sorted to maintain a consistent order.

The function ultimately returns a dictionary structured to indicate that an "image" is a required input type. The value associated with "image" is a tuple containing the sorted list of files and a dictionary that specifies an additional property, "image_upload", set to True. This indicates that the files listed are intended for upload as images.

The INPUT_TYPES function is particularly relevant in the context of the LoadImage class within the ldm_patched/contrib/external.py file. It is designed to provide a standardized way to access and specify the input files required for image loading operations.

### FunctionDef load_image(self, image)
**load_image**: The function of load_image is to load an image from a specified file path, process it, and return both the image and its corresponding mask.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· image: A string representing the name of the image file to be loaded.

**Code Description**: The load_image function begins by obtaining the full file path of the image using the get_annotated_filepath function from the ldm_patched.utils.path_utils module. This function constructs the path based on the provided image name, ensuring that the correct file is accessed.

Once the image path is retrieved, the function opens the image using the Image.open method from the PIL library. It initializes two empty lists, output_images and output_masks, to store the processed images and their corresponding masks.

The function then iterates over each frame of the image using ImageSequence.Iterator. For each frame, it applies exif_transpose to handle any orientation issues based on EXIF data. If the image mode is 'I', it normalizes the pixel values by scaling them to a range of [0, 1]. The image is then converted to RGB format and transformed into a NumPy array, which is subsequently converted to a PyTorch tensor and normalized by dividing by 255.0.

If the image contains an alpha channel (indicated by the presence of 'A' in the image bands), the function extracts the alpha channel as a mask, normalizes it, and inverts the values. If there is no alpha channel, a default mask of zeros with a shape of (64, 64) is created.

The processed image and mask are appended to their respective lists. After processing all frames, the function checks the length of output_images. If there are multiple images, it concatenates them along the first dimension; otherwise, it selects the single image and mask.

Finally, the function returns a tuple containing the processed image tensor and the corresponding mask tensor.

This function is crucial for loading and preparing images for further processing in the project, ensuring that images are correctly formatted and masks are generated when applicable.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the image file exists at the specified path and that the necessary libraries (PIL, NumPy, and PyTorch) are properly imported and available in the environment.

**Output Example**: A possible return value of the load_image function could be a tuple containing a tensor representing the image and a tensor representing the mask, such as (tensor([[...]]), tensor([[...]])) where the ellipses represent the pixel values of the image and mask respectively.

This function processes the image name to determine the appropriate directory and constructs the complete path to the image file.

Once the image path is obtained, the function initializes a SHA-256 hash object using the `hashlib` library. It then opens the image file in binary read mode ('rb') and reads its content. The content is fed into the hash object using the `update` method, which allows the hash to be computed incrementally as the file is read.

Finally, the function returns the hexadecimal representation of the hash digest by calling the `digest` method followed by `hex()`. This output serves as a unique identifier for the content of the image file, allowing for easy comparison to determine if the image has changed since the last time it was processed.

The IS_CHANGED function is particularly useful in scenarios where it is necessary to track changes to image files, such as in image processing pipelines or applications that require validation of file integrity.

It utilizes the exists_annotated_filepath function from the ldm_patched.utils.path_utils module to determine if the specified image file exists in the appropriate directory. The function first checks if the image file exists by calling exists_annotated_filepath with the image parameter. If the file does not exist, it returns a string message indicating that the image file is invalid, formatted to include the specific image path. If the file exists, the function returns True, indicating successful validation.

This function plays a crucial role in ensuring that the application has access to the necessary image files before proceeding with further operations. It is typically called in scenarios where the presence of an image file is essential for the subsequent processing steps, thereby preventing potential errors that could arise from missing files.

The relationship between VALIDATE_INPUTS and exists_annotated_filepath is significant, as VALIDATE_INPUTS relies on the latter to perform the actual check for file existence. This modular approach enhances code maintainability and clarity, allowing for a centralized validation mechanism that can be reused across different parts of the application.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the image parameter passed to VALIDATE_INPUTS is a valid file path string. If the path is incorrect or malformed, the function will still return a message indicating the file is invalid, but it may not provide specific insights into the nature of the error.

**Output Example**: A possible return value of the VALIDATE_INPUTS function could be "Invalid image file: /path/to/image.jpg" if the file does not exist, or True if the file is valid and exists at the specified path.

## ClassDef LoadImageMask
**LoadImageMask**: The function of LoadImageMask is to load a specified color channel from an image file and return it as a mask.

**attributes**: The attributes of this Class.
· _color_channels: A list of color channel names, specifically ["alpha", "red", "green", "blue"].

**Code Description**: The LoadImageMask class provides functionality to load a specific color channel from an image file and return it as a mask. It contains several methods that facilitate this process:

1. **INPUT_TYPES**: This class method retrieves the input directory for images and generates a dictionary of required inputs. It lists all image files in the input directory and provides options for selecting an image and a color channel from the predefined _color_channels attribute.

2. **CATEGORY**: This attribute categorizes the class under "mask", indicating its purpose in handling image masks.

3. **RETURN_TYPES**: This attribute specifies the return type of the load_image method, which is a tuple containing "MASK".

4. **FUNCTION**: This attribute indicates the name of the primary function of the class, which is "load_image".

5. **load_image**: This instance method takes an image and a channel as inputs. It retrieves the annotated file path of the image, opens the image using the PIL library, and checks its color bands. If the image does not have the expected RGBA format, it converts it accordingly. The specified channel is then extracted, and if it is the alpha channel, it inverts the mask. If the channel is not present, it returns a zero-filled tensor of shape (64, 64). The method returns the mask as a tensor with an additional dimension.

6. **IS_CHANGED**: This class method checks if the image file has changed by computing its SHA-256 hash. It reads the image file in binary mode and updates the hash object with its content, returning the hexadecimal digest.

7. **VALIDATE_INPUTS**: This class method validates the input image by checking if the annotated file path exists. If the file does not exist, it returns an error message; otherwise, it returns True.

**Note**: When using this class, ensure that the input image files are correctly annotated and located in the specified input directory. The class expects images to be in a format that includes the specified color channels.

**Output Example**: A possible appearance of the code's return value when loading the red channel from an image might look like this:
```
(tensor([[0.1, 0.2, 0.3, ..., 0.0],
          [0.0, 0.1, 0.4, ..., 0.5],
          ...]),)
``` 
This output represents a tensor containing normalized pixel values of the red channel, with an additional dimension for batch processing.
### FunctionDef INPUT_TYPES(s)
**INPUT_TYPES**: The function of INPUT_TYPES is to retrieve and structure the required input types for image processing, specifically returning a dictionary that includes available image files and color channel options.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· s: An instance of a class that contains the attribute _color_channels, which is used to provide the available color channels.

**Code Description**: The INPUT_TYPES function begins by calling the get_input_directory function from the ldm_patched.utils.path_utils module. This function is responsible for returning the path to the current input directory where files are stored. The INPUT_TYPES function then lists all files in this directory, filtering to include only those that are actual files (as opposed to directories). 

The function constructs and returns a dictionary with a key "required". This dictionary contains two entries: 
1. "image": This entry is a tuple where the first element is a sorted list of filenames found in the input directory, and the second element is a dictionary indicating that image upload is enabled (image_upload: True).
2. "channel": This entry is a tuple containing the color channels available, which is accessed through the _color_channels attribute of the instance s.

The relationship between INPUT_TYPES and its callees is significant as it relies on the get_input_directory function to dynamically obtain the path to the input directory. This ensures that the INPUT_TYPES function can adapt to changes in the file structure without hardcoding paths. Furthermore, the structured output of INPUT_TYPES is essential for other components of the application that require specific input formats, thereby facilitating a modular approach to handling image data.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the input directory contains valid image files for the function to return meaningful results. Additionally, the _color_channels attribute of the instance s must be properly defined to avoid errors in the output.

**Output Example**: A possible return value of the INPUT_TYPES function could be:
{
    "required": {
        "image": (["image1.jpg", "image2.png", "image3.bmp"], {"image_upload": True}),
        "channel": (["RGB", "RGBA"],)
    }
}
***
### FunctionDef load_image(self, image, channel)
**load_image**: The function of load_image is to load an image from a specified file path, extract a specific channel from the image, and return it as a tensor.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· image: A string representing the name of the image file, which may include annotations for file type.
· channel: A list or tuple containing the channel(s) to be extracted from the image, where the first element indicates the desired channel.

**Code Description**: The load_image function begins by obtaining the full file path of the image using the get_annotated_filepath function from the ldm_patched.utils.path_utils module. This function processes the provided image name to determine the appropriate directory and constructs the complete file path.

Once the image path is retrieved, the function opens the image using the PIL library's Image.open method. It then applies the exif_transpose method to ensure that the image is correctly oriented based on its EXIF data.

The function checks the bands of the image to determine if they match the expected channels: "R", "G", "B", and "A". If the image is in a mode that does not directly correspond to these channels (for example, if it is in 'I' mode), it normalizes the pixel values to a range of 0 to 1. Subsequently, it converts the image to "RGBA" format to ensure that it has four channels.

Next, the function initializes a mask variable to None and retrieves the first channel from the provided channel parameter, converting it to uppercase. It checks if this channel exists in the image's bands. If it does, the function extracts the corresponding channel using the getchannel method, converts it to a NumPy array, and normalizes the values to a range of 0 to 1. This array is then converted to a PyTorch tensor.

If the specified channel is 'A' (alpha channel), the function inverts the mask values. If the specified channel is not found in the image, the function initializes the mask as a tensor of zeros with a shape of (64, 64).

Finally, the function returns the mask tensor, adding a new dimension to it using the unsqueeze method to ensure it has the correct shape for further processing.

This function is integral to the LoadImage and LoadImageMask classes within the ldm_patched/contrib/external.py file, as it facilitates the loading and processing of images for various applications in the project.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the image file exists at the specified path and that the channel provided is valid to avoid runtime errors during image processing.

**Output Example**: A possible return value of the load_image function could be a tensor representing the extracted channel, such as a PyTorch tensor with shape (1, 64, 64) containing normalized pixel values.
***
### FunctionDef IS_CHANGED(s, image, channel)
**IS_CHANGED**: The function of IS_CHANGED is to compute the SHA-256 hash of a specified image file, indicating whether the image has changed based on its content.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· s: An unused parameter that may be intended for future use or for compatibility with other functions.
· image: A string representing the name of the image file for which the hash is to be computed.
· channel: An unused parameter that may be intended for future use or for compatibility with other functions.

**Code Description**: The IS_CHANGED function begins by calling the `get_annotated_filepath` function from the `ldm_patched.utils.path_utils` module to obtain the full file path of the specified image. This function processes the provided image name to determine the appropriate directory and constructs the complete path to the image file.

Once the image path is retrieved, the function initializes a SHA-256 hash object using the `hashlib` library. It then opens the image file in binary read mode ('rb') and reads its contents. The read data is fed into the hash object, which updates its internal state to reflect the contents of the file. After reading the entire file, the function computes the final hash digest and converts it to a hexadecimal string representation using the `hex()` method.

The primary purpose of this function is to provide a unique identifier for the content of the image file. If the content of the image changes, the resulting hash will also change, allowing for easy detection of modifications.

This function is particularly useful in scenarios where it is necessary to track changes to image files, such as in image processing pipelines or when managing datasets. By comparing the hash values of images, developers can determine whether an image has been altered since it was last processed or stored.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the image file exists at the specified path before calling this function to avoid file-related errors. Additionally, the parameters `s` and `channel` are currently not utilized within the function, which may indicate that they are placeholders for future enhancements or compatibility with other functions.

**Output Example**: A possible return value of the IS_CHANGED function could be a string representing the SHA-256 hash of the image file, such as "a3f5c8e1d7b9e3c5e1c5f7e8b9d3a1e7c8b9f3e1a2b3c4d5e6f7a8b9c0d1e2f3".
***
### FunctionDef VALIDATE_INPUTS(s, image)
**VALIDATE_INPUTS**: The function of VALIDATE_INPUTS is to verify the existence of a specified image file and return an appropriate response based on its validity.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· s: An instance of a class that is likely used to maintain the state or context in which the function operates.
· image: A string representing the file path of the image that needs to be validated.

**Code Description**: The VALIDATE_INPUTS function begins by checking if the provided image file exists using the exists_annotated_filepath function from the ldm_patched.utils.path_utils module. This function is crucial as it determines whether a file with the specified name exists in the appropriate directory, which may depend on annotations in the file name. If the image file does not exist, VALIDATE_INPUTS returns a string indicating that the image file is invalid, including the name of the file for clarity. If the file is found to exist, the function returns True, indicating that the input is valid.

The relationship between VALIDATE_INPUTS and exists_annotated_filepath is significant, as VALIDATE_INPUTS relies on the latter to perform the actual check for file existence. This modular approach allows for better code organization and reusability, as exists_annotated_filepath can be used in other validation contexts within the application.

**Note**: It is essential to ensure that the image parameter passed to VALIDATE_INPUTS is a valid string representing a file path. Additionally, the existence check performed by exists_annotated_filepath depends on the proper initialization of global directory variables to avoid returning incorrect results.

**Output Example**: A possible return value of the VALIDATE_INPUTS function could be "Invalid image file: /path/to/image.jpg" if the file does not exist, or True if the file is valid and exists in the specified location.
***
## ClassDef ImageScale
**ImageScale**: The function of ImageScale is to upscale images using various methods and specified dimensions.

**attributes**: The attributes of this Class.
· upscale_methods: A list of available methods for upscaling images, including "nearest-exact", "bilinear", "area", "bicubic", and "lanczos".
· crop_methods: A list of cropping options, which includes "disabled" and "center".

**Code Description**: The ImageScale class is designed to facilitate the upscaling of images through a defined interface. It includes a class method INPUT_TYPES that specifies the required input parameters for the upscaling operation. The parameters include:
- image: The input image to be upscaled, which is required.
- upscale_method: The method to be used for upscaling, selected from the predefined upscale_methods.
- width: The desired width of the output image, which is an integer with a default value of 512 and must be within the range of 0 to MAX_RESOLUTION.
- height: The desired height of the output image, which is also an integer with a default value of 512 and must be within the range of 0 to MAX_RESOLUTION.
- crop: The cropping method to be applied, selected from the predefined crop_methods.

The RETURN_TYPES attribute indicates that the output of the upscale method will be an image. The FUNCTION attribute specifies that the main operation of the class is performed by the "upscale" method.

The upscale method itself takes the specified parameters and processes the input image. If both width and height are set to 0, the original image is returned unchanged. If either dimension is specified, the method calculates the missing dimension based on the aspect ratio of the input image. The method then calls a utility function, common_upscale, to perform the actual upscaling operation, applying the specified upscale method and cropping option. Finally, the processed image is returned in a format suitable for further use.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the width and height parameters are set appropriately to avoid unexpected results. The maximum resolution is defined by the constant MAX_RESOLUTION, which should be adhered to when specifying dimensions.

**Output Example**: The output of the upscale method could resemble a tuple containing the upscaled image, such as:
(image_upscaled,) where image_upscaled is the resulting image after applying the specified upscaling method and dimensions.
### FunctionDef INPUT_TYPES(s)
**INPUT_TYPES**: The function of INPUT_TYPES is to define and return the required input types for image processing parameters.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· parameter1: s - An instance of a class that contains attributes for upscale methods and crop methods.

**Code Description**: The INPUT_TYPES function constructs a dictionary that specifies the required input types for an image processing operation. The returned dictionary has a single key, "required", which maps to another dictionary containing the following keys and their corresponding value types:

- "image": This key expects a value of type "IMAGE", indicating that an image input is required for processing.
- "upscale_method": This key retrieves the upscale methods from the instance `s`, allowing for flexible selection of methods based on the context in which the function is called.
- "width": This key is associated with an integer type ("INT") and includes additional constraints such as a default value of 512, a minimum value of 0, a maximum value defined by the constant MAX_RESOLUTION, and a step increment of 1. This ensures that the width input adheres to specific numerical limits.
- "height": Similar to "width", this key also expects an integer type ("INT") with the same constraints: a default value of 512, a minimum of 0, a maximum of MAX_RESOLUTION, and a step of 1.
- "crop": This key retrieves the crop methods from the instance `s`, allowing users to specify how the image should be cropped during processing.

The function effectively organizes the input requirements, ensuring that users provide valid and structured data for image processing tasks.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the values provided for "width" and "height" do not exceed the MAX_RESOLUTION constant to avoid runtime errors. Additionally, the upscale_method and crop methods should be defined within the instance `s` prior to calling this function.

{
    "required": {
        "image": ("IMAGE",),
        "upscale_method": ("BICUBIC", "NEAREST", "LINEAR"),
        "width": ("INT", {"default": 512, "min": 0, "max": 2048, "step": 1}),
        "height": ("INT", {"default": 512, "min": 0, "max": 2048, "step": 1}),
        "crop": ("CENTER", "TOP_LEFT", "BOTTOM_RIGHT")
    }
}
***
### FunctionDef upscale(self, image, upscale_method, width, height, crop)
**upscale**: The function of upscale is to resize an image tensor to specified dimensions using a chosen upscaling method, with optional cropping.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· image: A tensor representing the input image that needs to be upscaled. The expected shape is (N, C, H, W), where N is the number of images, C is the number of channels, H is the height, and W is the width.  
· upscale_method: A string indicating the method used for upscaling, which can be "bislerp", "lanczos", or any other valid mode supported by PyTorch's interpolation function.  
· width: An integer specifying the target width for the resized images. If set to 0, the width will be calculated based on the height.  
· height: An integer specifying the target height for the resized images. If set to 0, the height will be calculated based on the width.  
· crop: A string that determines the cropping strategy; it can be "center" to crop the center of the image or any other value to skip cropping.

**Code Description**: The upscale function begins by checking the values of the width and height parameters. If both are set to 0, it simply returns the original image tensor without any modifications. If either width or height is specified as 0, the function calculates the missing dimension based on the aspect ratio of the input image tensor.

Next, the function rearranges the dimensions of the input image tensor using the movedim method, which changes the order of the dimensions to prepare the data for the upscaling process. The function then calls the common_upscale function from the ldm_patched.modules.utils module, passing the rearranged image tensor along with the specified width, height, upscale_method, and crop parameters. This function handles the actual resizing of the image tensor according to the specified criteria.

After the upscaling operation is completed, the function rearranges the dimensions of the resulting tensor back to the original order using movedim again. Finally, it returns the upscaled image tensor as a single-element tuple.

The upscale function is designed to be flexible and can be used in various contexts where image resizing is required. It leverages the common_upscale function to ensure that the upscaling process is consistent and adheres to the specified parameters.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the input tensor (image) is in the correct shape and data type before calling the upscale function. The function assumes that the input tensor is a 4-dimensional tensor representing a batch of images.

**Output Example**: Given an input tensor of shape (1, 3, 4, 4) representing a single image with 3 color channels and a size of 4x4, calling upscale with width=8, height=8, upscale_method="bislerp", and crop="center" would return a tensor of shape (1, 3, 8, 8) containing the resized image data.
***
## ClassDef ImageScaleBy
**ImageScaleBy**: The function of ImageScaleBy is to upscale images using various methods based on a specified scale factor.

**attributes**: The attributes of this Class.
· upscale_methods: A list of available methods for upscaling images, including "nearest-exact", "bilinear", "area", "bicubic", and "lanczos".

**Code Description**: The ImageScaleBy class is designed for image processing, specifically for upscaling images. It contains a class-level attribute, `upscale_methods`, which defines the different algorithms that can be used for the upscaling process. The class provides a method `INPUT_TYPES`, which specifies the required input types for the upscaling operation. This method returns a dictionary indicating that the inputs must include an image of type "IMAGE", a chosen upscale method from the predefined list, and a scaling factor of type "FLOAT" with constraints on its value (defaulting to 1.0, with a minimum of 0.01 and a maximum of 8.0).

The class also defines a `RETURN_TYPES` attribute that indicates the output type of the upscaling function, which is an "IMAGE". The main functionality is encapsulated in the `upscale` method, which takes three parameters: `image`, `upscale_method`, and `scale_by`. 

Inside the `upscale` method, the input image is first rearranged using `movedim` to prepare it for processing. The new dimensions for the upscaled image are calculated by multiplying the original dimensions by the `scale_by` factor. The `common_upscale` function from the `ldm_patched.modules.utils` module is then called to perform the actual upscaling using the specified method. After processing, the resulting image is rearranged back to its original format and returned as a single-element tuple.

**Note**: When using the ImageScaleBy class, ensure that the input image is in the correct format and that the upscale method chosen is valid. The scale factor should be within the specified range to avoid errors during processing.

**Output Example**: An example of the output from the `upscale` method could be a tuple containing an upscaled image array, which may look like this: (array([[[[...]]]]),). The exact structure of the array will depend on the input image and the chosen upscale method.
### FunctionDef INPUT_TYPES(s)
**INPUT_TYPES**: The function of INPUT_TYPES is to define the required input types for a specific image processing operation.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· parameter1: s - An object that provides access to various upscale methods.

**Code Description**: The INPUT_TYPES function returns a dictionary that specifies the required input types for an image processing function. The dictionary contains a single key, "required", which maps to another dictionary detailing the specific inputs needed. 

1. The first input is "image", which is expected to be of type "IMAGE". This indicates that the function requires an image input for processing.
2. The second input is "upscale_method", which retrieves a tuple of upscale methods from the provided object `s`. This allows the user to select from various methods for image upscaling.
3. The third input is "scale_by", which is defined as a float type. It includes additional constraints: a default value of 1.0, a minimum value of 0.01, a maximum value of 8.0, and a step increment of 0.01. This input allows users to specify a scaling factor for the image processing operation.

The structure of the returned dictionary ensures that all necessary inputs are clearly defined, facilitating proper usage of the image processing function.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the inputs conform to the specified types and constraints to avoid errors during execution. Users should be aware of the valid range for the "scale_by" parameter to ensure effective image scaling.

**Output Example**: A possible appearance of the code's return value could be:
{
    "required": {
        "image": ("IMAGE",),
        "upscale_method": ("METHOD_A", "METHOD_B", "METHOD_C"),
        "scale_by": ("FLOAT", {"default": 1.0, "min": 0.01, "max": 8.0, "step": 0.01})
    }
}
***
### FunctionDef upscale(self, image, upscale_method, scale_by)
**upscale**: The function of upscale is to resize an input image tensor to specified dimensions using a chosen upscaling method.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· image: A tensor representing the input image, which is expected to have a shape compatible with image processing tasks.  
· upscale_method: A string indicating the method used for upscaling, which can be "bislerp", "lanczos", or any other valid mode supported by PyTorch's interpolation function.  
· scale_by: A float that specifies the scaling factor by which the image dimensions will be multiplied.

**Code Description**: The upscale function begins by rearranging the dimensions of the input image tensor using the movedim method, which changes the order of the dimensions to prepare it for processing. Specifically, it moves the last dimension (representing color channels) to the second position, resulting in a tensor shape of (N, C, H, W), where N is the batch size, C is the number of channels, H is the height, and W is the width.

Next, the function calculates the new width and height for the image by multiplying the original dimensions by the scale_by factor and rounding the results to the nearest integer. This ensures that the new dimensions are appropriate for the upscaling operation.

The function then calls the common_upscale function from the ldm_patched.modules.utils module, passing the modified image tensor along with the calculated width, height, upscale_method, and a fixed crop parameter set to "disabled". The common_upscale function handles the actual resizing of the image based on the specified upscaling method and dimensions.

After the upscaling operation, the resulting tensor is rearranged back to its original dimension order using movedim, moving the second dimension back to the last position. Finally, the function returns the upscaled image tensor as a single-element tuple.

The upscale function is designed to be used in various image processing workflows where resizing images is necessary. It relies on the common_upscale function to perform the heavy lifting of the resizing operation, ensuring that the upscaling process is modular and can accommodate different methods of interpolation.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the input image tensor is in the correct shape and data type before calling the upscale function. The function assumes that the input tensor is compatible with the expected format for image processing.

**Output Example**: Given an input tensor of shape (1, 3, 4, 4) representing a single image with 3 color channels and a size of 4x4, calling upscale with upscale_method="bislerp" and scale_by=2 would return a tensor of shape (1, 3, 8, 8) containing the resized image data.
***
## ClassDef ImageInvert
**ImageInvert**: The function of ImageInvert is to invert the colors of an image.

**attributes**: The attributes of this Class.
· INPUT_TYPES: A class method that specifies the input types required by the class. It requires an image of type "IMAGE".  
· RETURN_TYPES: A tuple indicating the type of output returned by the class, which is "IMAGE".  
· FUNCTION: A string that represents the name of the function to be executed, which is "invert".  
· CATEGORY: A string that categorizes the functionality of the class, which is "image".  

**Code Description**: The ImageInvert class is designed to perform a specific image processing operation: inverting the colors of an image. The class contains a class method `INPUT_TYPES`, which defines the required input for the operation. In this case, it requires an input of type "IMAGE". The class also defines a constant `RETURN_TYPES`, which indicates that the output will also be of type "IMAGE". The `FUNCTION` attribute specifies that the main operation of this class is encapsulated in the `invert` method.

The `invert` method takes an image as its parameter and applies a simple mathematical operation to invert the colors. The operation performed is `s = 1.0 - image`, where `image` is expected to be a numerical representation of the image's pixel values. This operation effectively flips the color values, resulting in an inverted image. The method then returns a tuple containing the inverted image.

**Note**: When using the ImageInvert class, ensure that the input provided is in the correct format and type as specified. The output will also need to be handled as an image type.

**Output Example**: If the input image is represented as a 2D array of pixel values, for example, a grayscale image where pixel values range from 0 to 1, an input of `[[0.0, 0.5], [1.0, 0.2]]` would yield an output of `[[1.0, 0.5], [0.0, 0.8]]`, representing the inverted pixel values.
### FunctionDef INPUT_TYPES(s)
**INPUT_TYPES**: The function of INPUT_TYPES is to define the required input types for an image processing function.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· parameter1: s - This parameter is not utilized within the function and serves as a placeholder for potential future use or for compatibility with a specific interface.

**Code Description**: The INPUT_TYPES function returns a dictionary that specifies the required input types for an image processing operation. The returned dictionary contains a single key, "required", which maps to another dictionary. This inner dictionary has one key, "image", which is associated with a tuple containing a single string, "IMAGE". This structure indicates that the function expects an input of type "IMAGE" under the key "image". The design of this function allows for easy expansion in the future, should additional input types be necessary.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the input provided to any function utilizing INPUT_TYPES adheres to the specified type, which in this case is "IMAGE". Failure to provide the correct input type may result in errors during processing.

**Output Example**: An example of the return value from the INPUT_TYPES function would be:
{
    "required": {
        "image": ("IMAGE",)
    }
}
***
### FunctionDef invert(self, image)
**invert**: The function of invert is to compute the inverted values of a given image.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· image: A numerical array representing the pixel values of the image to be inverted. The values should be in a range that allows for inversion, typically between 0 and 1.

**Code Description**: The invert function takes a single parameter, `image`, which is expected to be a numerical array. The function performs an inversion operation on the pixel values of the image by subtracting each pixel value from 1. This is achieved through the expression `s = 1.0 - image`, where `s` will contain the inverted pixel values. The function then returns a tuple containing the inverted image values as its sole element. The output format is a single-element tuple, which is a common practice in Python to ensure that the return type is consistent, even if there is only one value.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the input image values are within the appropriate range (0 to 1) for the inversion to work correctly. If the input values exceed this range, the output may not represent valid pixel values.

**Output Example**: For an input image array of `[0.2, 0.5, 0.8]`, the function would return `((0.8, 0.5, 0.2),)`, representing the inverted pixel values.
***
## ClassDef ImageBatch
**ImageBatch**: The function of ImageBatch is to combine two images into a single batch, ensuring that both images have the same dimensions.

· INPUT_TYPES: Specifies the required input types for the class method. It requires two images, "image1" and "image2", both of which must be of type "IMAGE".  
· RETURN_TYPES: Defines the return type of the batch method, which is a tuple containing a single "IMAGE".  
· FUNCTION: Indicates the name of the function that will be executed, which is "batch".  
· CATEGORY: Classifies the functionality of the class under the category "image".

**Code Description**: The ImageBatch class is designed to facilitate the processing of two images by combining them into a single tensor batch. The class contains a class method INPUT_TYPES that specifies the required inputs, which are two images. The RETURN_TYPES attribute indicates that the output will be a single image tensor. The FUNCTION attribute names the method that performs the operation, which is "batch". The CATEGORY attribute categorizes this functionality under image processing.

The core functionality is implemented in the batch method. This method takes two images as input parameters. It first checks if the spatial dimensions (height and width) of the two images are the same. If the dimensions do not match, it uses a utility function, common_upscale, to upscale the second image (image2) to match the dimensions of the first image (image1). The upscaling is performed using bilinear interpolation. After ensuring both images have the same dimensions, the method concatenates the two images along the first dimension (batch dimension) using PyTorch's torch.cat function. Finally, the method returns a tuple containing the concatenated image tensor.

**Note**: It is essential to ensure that the input images are of compatible types and dimensions before calling the batch method. The method will automatically handle dimension mismatches by upscaling the second image.

**Output Example**: If image1 has a shape of (3, 256, 256) and image2 has a shape of (3, 128, 128), after processing, the output will be a single tensor with a shape of (6, 256, 256) if image2 is upscaled to match image1's dimensions.
### FunctionDef INPUT_TYPES(s)
**INPUT_TYPES**: The function of INPUT_TYPES is to define the required input types for processing images.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· parameter1: s - This parameter is not utilized within the function and serves no purpose in the current implementation.

**Code Description**: The INPUT_TYPES function returns a dictionary that specifies the required input types for two images, labeled as "image1" and "image2". The dictionary structure consists of a single key, "required", which maps to another dictionary. This inner dictionary contains two entries: "image1" and "image2", both of which are associated with a tuple containing the string "IMAGE". This indicates that both inputs must be of the type "IMAGE". The function does not perform any operations on the input parameter 's' and simply returns the predefined structure.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the inputs provided to this function conform to the specified types, as the function is designed to enforce the requirement for image inputs. Any deviation from the expected input types may lead to errors in subsequent processing.

**Output Example**: A possible appearance of the code's return value could be:
{
    "required": {
        "image1": ("IMAGE",),
        "image2": ("IMAGE",)
    }
}

### FunctionDef batch(self, image1, image2)
**batch**: The function of batch is to concatenate two image tensors after ensuring they have the same dimensions.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· image1: A tensor representing the first batch of images, with shape (N, C, H, W), where N is the number of images, C is the number of channels, H is the height, and W is the width.  
· image2: A tensor representing the second batch of images, which may need to be upscaled to match the dimensions of image1.

**Code Description**: The batch function begins by checking if the spatial dimensions (height and width) of image1 and image2 are the same. If they are not, it calls the common_upscale function from the ldm_patched.modules.utils module to upscale image2 to match the dimensions of image1. The upscaling is performed using bilinear interpolation and centers the image during the process. The common_upscale function takes care of resizing image2 by adjusting its shape to (N, C, H, W) as required.

Once the dimensions of both image tensors are confirmed to be compatible, the function concatenates them along the first dimension (dim=0) using the torch.cat function. This results in a single tensor that contains both sets of images, effectively combining the two batches into one.

The batch function is essential for workflows that require processing multiple image batches together, ensuring that all images are of the same size before concatenation. This is particularly useful in scenarios such as training deep learning models, where uniform input dimensions are necessary.

**Note**: It is crucial to ensure that image1 and image2 are both tensors of the correct shape and data type before invoking the batch function. The function assumes that the input tensors are in the format expected for image data.

**Output Example**: Given image1 with shape (2, 3, 64, 64) and image2 with shape (1, 3, 32, 32), after calling batch, the output would be a tensor of shape (3, 3, 64, 64) if image2 is successfully upscaled to match the dimensions of image1.

## ClassDef EmptyImage
**EmptyImage**: The function of EmptyImage is to generate an empty image of specified dimensions and color.

**attributes**: The attributes of this Class.
· device: Specifies the device on which the image will be created, defaulting to "cpu".

**Code Description**: The EmptyImage class is designed to create an empty image tensor filled with a specified color. The constructor initializes the class with a device parameter, which defaults to "cpu". This allows the user to specify the computational device for image generation, which can be useful for performance optimization in environments that support GPU processing.

The class includes a class method INPUT_TYPES that defines the required input parameters for the image generation function. These parameters include:
- width: An integer representing the width of the image, with a default value of 512 and constraints on the minimum and maximum values.
- height: An integer representing the height of the image, also with a default value of 512 and similar constraints.
- batch_size: An integer indicating the number of images to generate, with a default of 1 and a maximum of 4096.
- color: An integer that defines the color of the image in RGB format, with a default value of 0 (black) and a maximum value of 0xFFFFFF (white).

The RETURN_TYPES attribute specifies that the output of the generate function will be an image tensor. The FUNCTION attribute indicates that the main operation of the class is performed by the generate method.

The generate method takes the specified width, height, batch size, and color as inputs. It creates three separate tensors for the red, green, and blue channels of the image, each filled with the corresponding color intensity. These channels are then concatenated along the last dimension to form a complete image tensor, which is returned as a single-element tuple.

**Note**: When using the EmptyImage class, ensure that the width and height parameters are within the defined limits. The color parameter should be provided in the correct integer format to represent RGB values accurately.

**Output Example**: A possible return value of the generate method when called with width=512, height=512, batch_size=1, and color=0xFF0000 (red) would be a tensor of shape [1, 512, 512, 3], where all pixels are set to red.
### FunctionDef __init__(self, device)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize an instance of the EmptyImage class with a specified device.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· device: A string that specifies the device on which the image will be processed. The default value is "cpu".

**Code Description**: The __init__ function is a constructor method that is called when an instance of the EmptyImage class is created. It takes one optional parameter, device, which allows the user to specify the computational device for the image processing tasks. By default, this parameter is set to "cpu", indicating that the operations will be performed on the central processing unit. The value of the device parameter is then assigned to the instance variable self.device, which can be used later in the class to determine where to execute computations or store data.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the specified device is supported by the underlying framework being used (e.g., PyTorch, TensorFlow) to avoid runtime errors. Users should be aware that if they wish to utilize a GPU for processing, they need to set the device parameter to the appropriate GPU identifier (e.g., "cuda:0" for the first GPU).

### FunctionDef INPUT_TYPES(s)
**INPUT_TYPES**: The function of INPUT_TYPES is to define and return the required input parameters for an image processing function.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· s: This parameter is not utilized within the function and serves as a placeholder for potential future use or for maintaining a consistent function signature.

**Code Description**: The INPUT_TYPES function constructs a dictionary that specifies the required input parameters for an image processing operation. The returned dictionary contains a single key, "required", which maps to another dictionary detailing the specific parameters needed. These parameters include:

- "width": An integer representing the width of the image. It has a default value of 512, with a minimum value of 1 and a maximum value defined by the constant MAX_RESOLUTION. The step size for this parameter is 1, allowing for incremental adjustments.
  
- "height": Similar to "width", this parameter is an integer that defines the height of the image. It also has a default value of 512, with the same minimum and maximum constraints as the width, and a step size of 1.
  
- "batch_size": This integer parameter indicates the number of images to be processed in a single batch. It has a default value of 1, a minimum value of 1, and a maximum value of 4096, allowing for flexibility in batch processing.
  
- "color": This integer parameter is used to specify a color value. It has a default value of 0, a minimum value of 0, and a maximum value of 0xFFFFFF (which represents the maximum value for a 24-bit color). The step size is set to 1, and it includes a display attribute indicating that it should be represented as a color picker in user interfaces.

The function is designed to facilitate the configuration of image processing tasks by clearly defining the necessary parameters and their constraints.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the values provided for width, height, batch_size, and color adhere to the specified constraints to avoid errors during processing. The MAX_RESOLUTION constant should be defined elsewhere in the code to ensure proper functionality.

**Output Example**: A possible appearance of the code's return value could be:
{
    "required": {
        "width": ("INT", {"default": 512, "min": 1, "max": MAX_RESOLUTION, "step": 1}),
        "height": ("INT", {"default": 512, "min": 1, "max": MAX_RESOLUTION, "step": 1}),
        "batch_size": ("INT", {"default": 1, "min": 1, "max": 4096}),
        "color": ("INT", {"default": 0, "min": 0, "max": 0xFFFFFF, "step": 1, "display": "color"})
    }
}

### FunctionDef generate(self, width, height, batch_size, color)
**generate**: The function of generate is to create a batch of images filled with a specified color.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· width: An integer representing the width of the generated images.
· height: An integer representing the height of the generated images.
· batch_size: An integer specifying the number of images to generate (default is 1).
· color: An integer representing the color of the images in RGB format, where the color is encoded as a single integer.

**Code Description**: The generate function creates a batch of images with the specified dimensions (width and height) and fills them with a uniform color. The function uses the PyTorch library to create three separate tensors for the red, green, and blue channels of the images. Each channel is filled with the corresponding color value derived from the input integer color. The color is extracted by using bitwise operations to isolate the red, green, and blue components. Specifically, the red component is obtained by shifting the color 16 bits to the right and masking with 0xFF, the green component is obtained by shifting 8 bits to the right and masking, and the blue component is obtained by masking the color directly. Each channel tensor is created with the shape [batch_size, height, width, 1], and then the three channels are concatenated along the last dimension to form the final output tensor, which has the shape [batch_size, height, width, 3]. The function returns a tuple containing this tensor.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the color parameter is provided in the correct RGB format as a single integer. The batch_size should be a positive integer to avoid unexpected behavior.

**Output Example**: If the function is called with generate(100, 100, batch_size=2, color=0xFF0000), the output will be a tuple containing a tensor of shape [2, 100, 100, 3], where each image is filled with the color red (RGB: 255, 0, 0).
***
## ClassDef ImagePadForOutpaint
**ImagePadForOutpaint**: The function of ImagePadForOutpaint is to expand an image by adding padding around it and creating a corresponding mask for feathering effects.

**attributes**: The attributes of this Class.
· INPUT_TYPES: A class method that defines the required input types for the image padding operation.
· RETURN_TYPES: Specifies the types of outputs returned by the expand_image method, which are an image and a mask.
· FUNCTION: The name of the method that performs the image expansion, which is "expand_image".
· CATEGORY: The category under which this class is organized, which is "image".

**Code Description**: The ImagePadForOutpaint class is designed to facilitate the padding of an image with specified dimensions on each side (left, top, right, bottom) and to apply a feathering effect to the edges of the padded area. The class includes a class method INPUT_TYPES that outlines the required parameters for the operation, including the image to be padded and the dimensions of the padding on each side, as well as a feathering parameter that controls the softness of the edges.

The expand_image method takes the input parameters and performs the following operations:
1. It retrieves the dimensions of the input image.
2. It creates a new image tensor filled with a default value (0.5) to represent the padded area.
3. The original image is then placed in the center of this new tensor, effectively adding the specified padding around it.
4. A mask tensor is created to represent the feathering effect, which is initialized to ones. If the feathering parameter is greater than zero, the method calculates the feathering values based on the distance from the edges of the original image to the padded area.
5. The mask is updated with feathering values, which are computed based on the minimum distance to the edges, ensuring that the feathering effect is applied smoothly.

The method returns a tuple containing the newly padded image and the corresponding mask.

**Note**: When using this class, ensure that the feathering value does not exceed the dimensions of the image to avoid unexpected results. The padding dimensions must also be within the defined maximum resolution limits.

**Output Example**: A possible output of the expand_image method could be a new image tensor of shape (d1, d2 + top + bottom, d3 + left + right, d4) filled with the original image in the center and a mask tensor of shape (d2 + top + bottom, d3 + left + right) representing the feathering effect applied around the edges.
### FunctionDef INPUT_TYPES(s)
**INPUT_TYPES**: The function of INPUT_TYPES is to define and return the required input types for the image padding operation.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· s: This parameter is a placeholder for the function and is not used within the function body.

**Code Description**: The INPUT_TYPES function constructs a dictionary that specifies the required input types for an image padding operation. The dictionary contains a single key, "required", which maps to another dictionary detailing the specific inputs needed. The inputs include:

- "image": This input expects a value of type "IMAGE", indicating that the user must provide an image for processing.
- "left": This input expects an integer ("INT") value, with a default of 0. It has constraints defined by a minimum value of 0, a maximum value defined by the constant MAX_RESOLUTION, and a step increment of 8.
- "top": Similar to "left", this input also expects an integer ("INT") with the same constraints and a default value of 0.
- "right": This input mirrors the "left" and "top" parameters, requiring an integer with the same constraints and a default of 0.
- "bottom": This input follows the same structure as the previous parameters, requiring an integer with a default of 0.
- "feathering": This input expects an integer ("INT") with a default value of 40. It has a minimum value of 0, a maximum value defined by MAX_RESOLUTION, and a step increment of 1.

The function effectively standardizes the input requirements for padding an image, ensuring that all necessary parameters are provided with appropriate types and constraints.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the values provided for "left", "top", "right", "bottom", and "feathering" adhere to the specified constraints to avoid errors during the image processing operation.

**Output Example**: A possible appearance of the code's return value could be:
{
    "required": {
        "image": ("IMAGE",),
        "left": ("INT", {"default": 0, "min": 0, "max": MAX_RESOLUTION, "step": 8}),
        "top": ("INT", {"default": 0, "min": 0, "max": MAX_RESOLUTION, "step": 8}),
        "right": ("INT", {"default": 0, "min": 0, "max": MAX_RESOLUTION, "step": 8}),
        "bottom": ("INT", {"default": 0, "min": 0, "max": MAX_RESOLUTION, "step": 8}),
        "feathering": ("INT", {"default": 40, "min": 0, "max": MAX_RESOLUTION, "step": 1}),
    }

### FunctionDef expand_image(self, image, left, top, right, bottom, feathering)
**expand_image**: The function of expand_image is to expand an image by adding padding around it and create a corresponding mask for feathering effects.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· image: A tensor representing the input image to be expanded, with dimensions corresponding to (batch size, height, width, channels).
· left: An integer specifying the number of pixels to add as padding on the left side of the image.
· top: An integer specifying the number of pixels to add as padding on the top side of the image.
· right: An integer specifying the number of pixels to add as padding on the right side of the image.
· bottom: An integer specifying the number of pixels to add as padding on the bottom side of the image.
· feathering: A float value that determines the extent of feathering applied to the edges of the mask.

**Code Description**: The expand_image function begins by extracting the dimensions of the input image, which are stored in variables d1, d2, d3, and d4. It then creates a new tensor called new_image, initialized to a constant value of 0.5, with dimensions that account for the original image size plus the specified padding on all sides. The original image is then placed into the center of this new tensor.

Next, a mask tensor is initialized to ones, with dimensions corresponding to the new padded size. A temporary tensor t is created to hold feathering values, initialized to zeros. If the feathering parameter is greater than zero and is less than half the height and width of the original image, the function enters a nested loop to calculate feathering values for each pixel in the original image. The feathering effect is applied based on the distance from the edges of the original image, where pixels closer to the edges receive lower values, creating a smooth transition effect.

Finally, the calculated feathering values are assigned to the appropriate section of the mask tensor, and the function returns both the new padded image and the corresponding mask.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the feathering parameter is set appropriately, as excessive feathering relative to the image dimensions may lead to unexpected results. The function assumes that the input image is a 4D tensor and that the padding values are non-negative integers.

**Output Example**: A possible return value of the function could be a tuple containing a new_image tensor of shape (d1, d2 + top + bottom, d3 + left + right, d4) filled with values around 0.5, and a mask tensor of shape (d2 + top + bottom, d3 + left + right) with feathering applied near the edges, represented by values ranging from 0 to 1.
***
## FunctionDef load_custom_node(module_path, ignore)
**load_custom_node**: The function of load_custom_node is to dynamically load a custom module from a specified file path and register its node class mappings and web directory if applicable.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· parameter1: module_path - A string representing the file path to the custom module that needs to be loaded.
· parameter2: ignore - A set of node class names that should be ignored during the loading process.

**Code Description**: The load_custom_node function is responsible for importing a custom module specified by the module_path parameter. It first determines the module name from the provided path and checks if the path points to a valid file. If the path is a file, it uses the file's base name as the module name. The function then attempts to create a module specification using importlib.util.spec_from_file_location, which allows for loading a module from a specific file location.

Once the module is loaded, the function checks for the presence of a WEB_DIRECTORY attribute within the module. If this attribute exists and is not None, it constructs an absolute path to the web directory and verifies its existence. If the directory is valid, it registers this directory in the EXTENSION_WEB_DIRS dictionary using the module name as the key.

The function also looks for NODE_CLASS_MAPPINGS within the module. If found, it iterates through the mappings, adding them to the global NODE_CLASS_MAPPINGS dictionary unless they are present in the ignore set. Additionally, if NODE_DISPLAY_NAME_MAPPINGS are defined in the module, these are merged into the global NODE_DISPLAY_NAME_MAPPINGS dictionary.

If the module does not contain NODE_CLASS_MAPPINGS, a message is printed to indicate that the module is being skipped. In case of any exceptions during the loading process, the error is printed along with a traceback, and the function returns False to indicate failure.

This function is called by load_custom_nodes and init_custom_nodes. The load_custom_nodes function retrieves paths to custom node directories and attempts to load each module found within those directories by calling load_custom_node. The init_custom_nodes function loads a predefined set of node files from a specific directory and also calls load_custom_nodes to ensure all custom nodes are initialized properly.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the module being loaded contains the necessary NODE_CLASS_MAPPINGS for it to be registered successfully. Additionally, the module should not be a disabled module (ending with .disabled) to be considered for loading.

**Output Example**: A successful execution of load_custom_node might return True, indicating that the module was loaded and its mappings were registered correctly. If the module lacks NODE_CLASS_MAPPINGS, it would return False, and a message would be printed indicating the reason for the failure.
## FunctionDef load_custom_nodes
**load_custom_nodes**: The function of load_custom_nodes is to load custom node modules from specified directories and measure the time taken for each import operation.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· None

**Code Description**: The load_custom_nodes function is designed to facilitate the dynamic loading of custom node modules from a designated folder named "custom_nodes." It begins by establishing a set of base node names derived from the global NODE_CLASS_MAPPINGS dictionary, which serves as a reference for the node classes that can be registered.

The function then retrieves the paths of the "custom_nodes" directory using the get_folder_paths function. This function is crucial as it provides the necessary paths where custom node modules may reside. After obtaining these paths, load_custom_nodes initializes an empty list, node_import_times, to track the import duration and success status of each module.

For each path in node_paths, the function lists the contents of the directory. It filters out the "__pycache__" directory, as it does not contain the actual module files needed for loading. The function then iterates through the remaining files, checking if each file is a valid Python file (i.e., it has a ".py" extension) and not marked as disabled (i.e., it does not end with ".disabled").

For each valid module file, load_custom_nodes records the start time of the import operation using time.perf_counter(). It then calls the load_custom_node function, passing the module path and the base node names as arguments. This function is responsible for the actual loading of the module and the registration of its node class mappings.

After attempting to load each module, the function appends a tuple containing the elapsed time, the module path, and the success status of the import operation to the node_import_times list. Once all modules have been processed, load_custom_nodes prints the import times for each custom node, indicating whether the import was successful or failed.

This function is called by init_custom_nodes, which is responsible for initializing a predefined set of node files from a specific directory. Within init_custom_nodes, load_custom_nodes is invoked to ensure that all custom nodes are loaded and initialized properly, thereby enhancing the functionality of the system by integrating additional node capabilities.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the "custom_nodes" directory exists and contains valid Python files for successful loading. Additionally, any modules that are disabled or do not contain NODE_CLASS_MAPPINGS will not be loaded, and appropriate messages will be printed to indicate any failures during the import process.
## FunctionDef init_custom_nodes
**init_custom_nodes**: The function of init_custom_nodes is to initialize custom nodes by loading predefined node files from a specific directory.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· None

**Code Description**: The init_custom_nodes function is responsible for setting up custom nodes within the application by loading a series of predefined Python files that define these nodes. It begins by constructing the path to a directory named "ldm_patched_extras," which is expected to contain various node module files. This is achieved using the os.path.join and os.path.dirname functions to ensure the correct path is formed based on the current file's location.

The function defines a list of node files, each corresponding to a specific type of custom node, such as "nodes_latent.py," "nodes_hypernetwork.py," and others. These files are essential for extending the functionality of the system by introducing new node types that can be utilized within the application.

For each node file in the predefined list, the function calls the load_custom_node function, passing the full path to the node file as an argument. This function is responsible for dynamically loading the specified module and registering its node class mappings. The load_custom_node function checks for the presence of necessary attributes within the module, such as NODE_CLASS_MAPPINGS, and handles any exceptions that may arise during the loading process.

After all the custom node files have been processed, the init_custom_nodes function also calls the load_custom_nodes function. This additional call ensures that any custom nodes located in the "custom_nodes" directory are also loaded and initialized, further enhancing the system's capabilities.

The init_custom_nodes function is crucial for setting up the environment with the necessary custom nodes, allowing users to leverage additional functionalities provided by the loaded modules.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the "ldm_patched_extras" directory exists and contains the specified node files for successful initialization. Additionally, the modules being loaded should contain the required NODE_CLASS_MAPPINGS for proper registration.
