## ClassDef Blend
**Blend**: The function of Blend is to perform image blending operations using specified blend modes and factors.

**attributes**: The attributes of this Class.
· INPUT_TYPES: Defines the required input types for the blending operation, including two images, a blend factor, and a blend mode.  
· RETURN_TYPES: Specifies the type of output returned by the blending operation, which is an image.  
· FUNCTION: Indicates the function that will be executed for blending images, which is "blend_images".  
· CATEGORY: Categorizes the class under "image/postprocessing".

**Code Description**: The Blend class is designed to facilitate the blending of two images using various blending modes and a specified blend factor. The class includes an initializer method, INPUT_TYPES class method, and two primary methods: blend_images and blend_mode.

The initializer method, `__init__`, does not perform any specific actions upon instantiation of the class.

The `INPUT_TYPES` class method returns a dictionary that specifies the required inputs for the blending operation. It includes:
- `image1`: The first image to blend, expected to be of type "IMAGE".
- `image2`: The second image to blend, also of type "IMAGE".
- `blend_factor`: A floating-point value that determines the weight of the second image in the final blend. It has a default value of 0.5, with a minimum of 0.0 and a maximum of 1.0, allowing for fine control over the blending process.
- `blend_mode`: A list of strings representing the available blending modes, including "normal", "multiply", "screen", "overlay", "soft_light", and "difference".

The `blend_images` method is the core functionality of the class. It takes two images (image1 and image2), a blend factor, and a blend mode as inputs. The method first ensures that both images are on the same device (e.g., CPU or GPU). If the shapes of the images do not match, it adjusts the second image's dimensions to match the first using a bicubic upscale method. The blending operation is then performed using the specified blend mode, followed by a linear interpolation between the two images based on the blend factor. The resulting blended image is clamped to ensure pixel values remain within the valid range of [0, 1].

The `blend_mode` method implements the logic for different blending modes. Depending on the selected mode, it applies the appropriate mathematical operation to blend the two images. The supported modes include:
- "normal": Returns the second image as is.
- "multiply": Multiplies the pixel values of both images.
- "screen": Applies a screen blending effect.
- "overlay": Combines the images using an overlay effect.
- "soft_light": Applies a soft light blending effect.
- "difference": Computes the difference between the two images.

The `g` method is a helper function used in the "soft_light" blending mode to perform a specific calculation based on the input values.

**Note**: When using the Blend class, ensure that the input images are compatible in terms of dimensions or that the class can upscale them as needed. The blend factor should be within the specified range to avoid unexpected results.

**Output Example**: A possible return value from the `blend_images` method could be a tensor representing a blended image, where pixel values are clamped between 0 and 1, such as:
```
tensor([[[0.5, 0.6, 0.7],
         [0.4, 0.5, 0.6]],
        [[0.3, 0.4, 0.5],
         [0.2, 0.3, 0.4]]])
```
### FunctionDef __init__(self)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize an instance of the class.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· There are no parameters for this function.

**Code Description**: The __init__ function is a special method in Python, commonly known as a constructor. This function is called when an instance (or object) of the class is created. In this specific implementation, the __init__ function does not perform any operations as it contains only the `pass` statement. The `pass` statement is a placeholder that indicates that no action is taken. This means that while the function is defined, it does not initialize any attributes or perform any setup for the class instance. The presence of this method allows for future enhancements where initialization logic can be added without altering the structure of the class.

**Note**: It is important to recognize that even though this __init__ function does not currently perform any operations, it serves as a foundation for potential future development. Developers may choose to implement initialization logic later, and having this method defined allows for that flexibility.
***
### FunctionDef INPUT_TYPES(s)
**INPUT_TYPES**: The function of INPUT_TYPES is to define and return the required input types for a blending operation involving two images.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· image1: This parameter expects an input of type "IMAGE", representing the first image to be blended.
· image2: This parameter also expects an input of type "IMAGE", representing the second image to be blended.
· blend_factor: This parameter expects a floating-point number ("FLOAT") that determines the ratio of blending between the two images. It has a default value of 0.5, with a minimum value of 0.0 and a maximum value of 1.0, allowing for increments of 0.01.
· blend_mode: This parameter expects a selection from a predefined list of blending modes, which includes "normal", "multiply", "screen", "overlay", "soft_light", and "difference".

**Code Description**: The INPUT_TYPES function is designed to specify the types of inputs required for a blending operation. It returns a dictionary containing a single key "required", which maps to another dictionary that defines the specific input parameters. Each parameter is associated with its expected type and, where applicable, additional constraints or options. The "image1" and "image2" parameters are straightforward, requiring image inputs. The "blend_factor" parameter is more complex, as it includes constraints on its value, ensuring that it falls within a specified range and has a defined step increment for precision. The "blend_mode" parameter allows users to select from a set of blending modes, providing flexibility in how the images are combined.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the inputs provided to this function adhere to the specified types and constraints to avoid errors during the blending operation. The blend_factor should be carefully chosen to achieve the desired visual effect, and the blend_mode should be selected based on the intended outcome of the image processing.

**Output Example**: An example of the return value from the INPUT_TYPES function could look like this:
{
    "required": {
        "image1": ("IMAGE",),
        "image2": ("IMAGE",),
        "blend_factor": ("FLOAT", {
            "default": 0.5,
            "min": 0.0,
            "max": 1.0,
            "step": 0.01
        }),
        "blend_mode": (["normal", "multiply", "screen", "overlay", "soft_light", "difference"],),
    },
}
***
### FunctionDef blend_images(self, image1, image2, blend_factor, blend_mode)
**blend_images**: The function of blend_images is to blend two images together using a specified blend factor and blending mode.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· parameter1: image1 - A torch.Tensor representing the first image to be blended.  
· parameter2: image2 - A torch.Tensor representing the second image to be blended.  
· parameter3: blend_factor - A float value that determines the weight of image2 in the final blended output.  
· parameter4: blend_mode - A string that specifies the blending mode to be applied during the blending process.

**Code Description**: The blend_images function is responsible for combining two image tensors, image1 and image2, based on a specified blend factor and blending mode. Initially, the function ensures that both images are on the same device by transferring image2 to the device of image1. It then checks if the shapes of the two images are compatible. If the shapes do not match, image2 is permuted to change its channel order from (N, H, W, C) to (N, C, H, W), where N is the batch size, H is the height, W is the width, and C is the number of channels. 

Following this, the function calls common_upscale from the ldm_patched.modules.utils module to resize image2 to match the dimensions of image1. The upscaling method used is bicubic interpolation, and the cropping strategy is set to 'center', ensuring that the resized image is centered correctly.

Once both images are prepared, the function invokes blend_mode, which applies the specified blending operation based on the blend_mode parameter. The result from blend_mode is then combined with image1 using the blend_factor, which determines how much of image2 contributes to the final output. The blending operation is performed using the formula: blended_image = image1 * (1 - blend_factor) + blended_image * blend_factor. Finally, the resulting blended image is clamped to ensure that all pixel values remain within the valid range of [0, 1].

This function is crucial for image processing tasks where combining images in various ways is necessary, such as in graphics applications or machine learning tasks involving image data.

**Note**: It is essential to ensure that image1 and image2 are of compatible shapes and types before calling blend_images. The function assumes that the input tensors are normalized to the range [0, 1] to avoid unexpected results during blending.

**Output Example**: For input tensors image1 and image2 representing images with values in the range [0, 1], calling blend_images with a blend_factor of 0.5 and a blend_mode of "normal" might yield a tensor where each pixel value is the average of the corresponding pixel values from image1 and image2, such as [0.3, 0.5, 0.7] and [0.4, 0.6, 0.8] resulting in [0.35, 0.55, 0.75].
***
### FunctionDef blend_mode(self, img1, img2, mode)
**blend_mode**: The function of blend_mode is to apply various blending modes to combine two images (img1 and img2) based on the specified mode.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· parameter1: img1 - A tensor representing the first image to be blended.  
· parameter2: img2 - A tensor representing the second image to be blended.  
· parameter3: mode - A string specifying the blending mode to be applied.

**Code Description**: The blend_mode function takes two image tensors (img1 and img2) and a mode string as input. It evaluates the mode and applies the corresponding blending operation. The supported modes include:

- "normal": Returns img2 directly, effectively replacing img1.
- "multiply": Performs a pixel-wise multiplication of img1 and img2, resulting in a darker image.
- "screen": Applies the screen blending mode, which lightens the image by inverting the colors, multiplying them, and then inverting again.
- "overlay": Combines the two images using a conditional operation based on the brightness of img1, enhancing contrast.
- "soft_light": Utilizes the g function to apply a piecewise transformation to img1 based on the intensity of img2, creating a soft light effect.
- "difference": Computes the difference between img1 and img2, resulting in an image that highlights the differences.

If an unsupported mode is provided, the function raises a ValueError, ensuring that only valid modes are processed.

The blend_mode function is called by the blend_images function, which is responsible for blending two images based on a specified blend factor and mode. Within blend_images, the input images are first checked for compatibility in shape and device. If necessary, img2 is resized to match img1's dimensions. After preparing the images, blend_images calls blend_mode to perform the actual blending operation. The result from blend_mode is then combined with img1 using the blend_factor to produce the final blended image, which is clamped to ensure pixel values remain within the valid range of [0, 1].

**Note**: It is important to ensure that img1 and img2 are of compatible shapes and types for the operations performed within blend_mode. The function assumes that the input tensors are normalized to the range [0, 1] to avoid unexpected results during blending.

**Output Example**: For input tensors img1 and img2 with values representing grayscale images, the output of blend_mode when using the "multiply" mode might yield a tensor with values that are the product of corresponding pixel values, such as [0.2, 0.4, 0.6] * [0.5, 0.5, 0.5] resulting in [0.1, 0.2, 0.3].
***
### FunctionDef g(self, x)
**g**: The function of g is to apply a piecewise transformation to the input tensor based on its values.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· parameter1: x - A tensor containing input values that will be transformed.

**Code Description**: The function g takes a tensor x as input and applies a conditional transformation based on the values within the tensor. Specifically, it uses the `torch.where` function to evaluate each element of x. If an element is less than or equal to 0.25, it computes a polynomial expression `((16 * x - 12) * x + 4) * x`, which is a cubic function that smoothly transitions values in that range. For elements greater than 0.25, it returns the square root of the element, `torch.sqrt(x)`. 

This function is utilized within the blend_mode function, specifically in the "soft_light" blending mode. In this context, g is called to adjust the brightness of img1 based on the intensity of img2. The output of g is used to modify img1 when img2 is greater than 0.5, allowing for a nuanced blending effect that enhances the visual quality of the resulting image. The relationship between g and blend_mode is crucial, as g provides the necessary transformation to achieve the desired soft light effect in image processing.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the input tensor x is of a compatible type and shape for the operations performed within g. The function assumes that the input values are within a reasonable range to avoid unexpected results from the square root operation.

**Output Example**: For an input tensor x with values [0.1, 0.3, 0.5], the output of g would be approximately [0.064, 0.5477, 0.7071], where 0.1 is transformed using the polynomial expression, and 0.3 and 0.5 are transformed using the square root function.
***
## FunctionDef gaussian_kernel(kernel_size, sigma, device)
**gaussian_kernel**: The function of gaussian_kernel is to generate a Gaussian kernel matrix based on the specified size and standard deviation.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· kernel_size: An integer that specifies the size of the kernel. It determines the dimensions of the output matrix, which will be (kernel_size, kernel_size).
· sigma: A float that represents the standard deviation of the Gaussian distribution. It controls the spread of the kernel values.
· device: An optional parameter that specifies the device (CPU or GPU) on which the tensor operations will be performed.

**Code Description**: The gaussian_kernel function creates a 2D Gaussian kernel using the specified kernel size and standard deviation. It first generates a grid of x and y coordinates using torch.meshgrid, which spans from -1 to 1. The distance from the center of the kernel is calculated using the Euclidean distance formula, resulting in a tensor d. The Gaussian function is then applied to this distance tensor, where the exponent is calculated as -(d * d) / (2.0 * sigma * sigma). This results in a Gaussian distribution matrix g. Finally, the kernel is normalized by dividing it by the sum of its elements, ensuring that the total sum of the kernel equals 1.

This function is called by two other functions in the project: blur and sharpen. In the blur function, gaussian_kernel is used to create a blurring effect on an image by generating a kernel based on the specified blur radius and sigma. The kernel is then applied to the image using a convolution operation. In the sharpen function, gaussian_kernel is utilized to create a sharpening effect. The kernel is modified to enhance the edges of the image by adjusting the center value and applying a negative scaling factor based on the alpha parameter. Both functions rely on the gaussian_kernel to produce the necessary kernel for their respective image processing tasks.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the kernel_size is an odd integer to maintain a symmetric kernel. The sigma value should be chosen based on the desired level of blurriness or sharpness, with larger values resulting in a smoother effect.

**Output Example**: A possible appearance of the code's return value for a kernel_size of 5 and sigma of 1.0 might look like the following 2D tensor:

```
tensor([[0.0038, 0.0159, 0.0235, 0.0159, 0.0038],
        [0.0159, 0.0665, 0.0997, 0.0665, 0.0159],
        [0.0235, 0.0997, 0.1494, 0.0997, 0.0235],
        [0.0159, 0.0665, 0.0997, 0.0665, 0.0159],
        [0.0038, 0.0159, 0.0235, 0.0159, 0.0038]])
```
## ClassDef Blur
**Blur**: The function of Blur is to apply a Gaussian blur effect to an image.

**attributes**: The attributes of this Class.
· image: The input image to be processed, represented as a tensor.
· blur_radius: The radius of the blur effect, which determines the size of the kernel used for blurring.
· sigma: The standard deviation of the Gaussian distribution, controlling the amount of blur applied.

**Code Description**: The Blur class is designed to perform image blurring using a Gaussian kernel. It contains an initializer method that sets up the class without any specific attributes. The class method INPUT_TYPES defines the required input types for the blur operation, specifying that an image tensor, an integer for blur_radius, and a float for sigma are necessary. The blur_radius must be between 1 and 31, while sigma must be between 0.1 and 10.0. 

The RETURN_TYPES attribute indicates that the output of the blur function will be an image tensor. The FUNCTION attribute specifies that the method to be called for processing is "blur". The CATEGORY attribute categorizes this operation under "image/postprocessing".

The blur method itself takes an image tensor, a blur_radius, and a sigma value as inputs. If the blur_radius is zero, the method returns the original image without any modifications. For non-zero blur_radius values, the method calculates the kernel size based on the blur_radius and generates a Gaussian kernel using the gaussian_kernel function. This kernel is then applied to the image using a convolution operation after padding the image to handle the borders appropriately. The image tensor is permuted to match the expected input format for PyTorch operations, and the final blurred image is returned in the original format.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the input image is in the correct tensor format and that the blur_radius and sigma values are within the specified ranges to avoid errors during processing.

**Output Example**: A possible appearance of the code's return value could be a tensor representing a blurred image, which retains the original dimensions but with softened edges and reduced detail, such as:
```
tensor([[[[0.1, 0.2, 0.3],
          [0.2, 0.3, 0.4],
          [0.3, 0.4, 0.5]]]])
```
### FunctionDef __init__(self)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize an instance of the class.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· There are no parameters for this function.

**Code Description**: The __init__ function is a constructor method in Python, which is automatically called when an instance of the class is created. In this specific implementation, the function does not perform any operations or initialize any attributes, as it contains only the `pass` statement. The `pass` statement is a placeholder that indicates that no action is to be taken. This means that while the constructor is defined, it does not set up any initial state or properties for the instance of the class. This can be useful in scenarios where the class may be extended in the future or when the initialization logic is not required at this stage.

**Note**: It is important to recognize that even though this constructor does not perform any actions, its presence allows for future modifications and enhancements. If attributes or initialization logic are needed later, they can be added without changing the method signature.
***
### FunctionDef INPUT_TYPES(s)
**INPUT_TYPES**: The function of INPUT_TYPES is to define and return the required input types for a blur processing function.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· s: This parameter is not utilized within the function and serves as a placeholder for potential future use or to maintain a consistent function signature.

**Code Description**: The INPUT_TYPES function constructs and returns a dictionary that specifies the required input types for an image processing operation involving a blur effect. The dictionary contains a single key, "required", which maps to another dictionary detailing the specific inputs needed for the operation. 

The inputs defined are:
- "image": This input expects a value of type "IMAGE", indicating that the function requires an image to be processed.
- "blur_radius": This input is of type "INT" and includes additional constraints:
  - "default": The default value is set to 1.
  - "min": The minimum allowable value is 1.
  - "max": The maximum allowable value is 31.
  - "step": The increment step for this input is 1, meaning users can only select whole numbers within the specified range.
  
- "sigma": This input is of type "FLOAT" and also includes constraints:
  - "default": The default value is set to 1.0.
  - "min": The minimum allowable value is 0.1.
  - "max": The maximum allowable value is 10.0.
  - "step": The increment step for this input is 0.1, allowing for more granular control over the value.

This structured approach ensures that users provide valid inputs when invoking the blur processing function, thereby enhancing the robustness and reliability of the image processing operation.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the inputs adhere to the specified types and constraints to avoid errors during processing. Users should be aware of the limits set for "blur_radius" and "sigma" to achieve the desired blur effect.

**Output Example**: A possible appearance of the code's return value could be:
{
    "required": {
        "image": ("IMAGE",),
        "blur_radius": ("INT", {
            "default": 1,
            "min": 1,
            "max": 31,
            "step": 1
        }),
        "sigma": ("FLOAT", {
            "default": 1.0,
            "min": 0.1,
            "max": 10.0,
            "step": 0.1
        }),
    },
}
***
### FunctionDef blur(self, image, blur_radius, sigma)
**blur**: The function of blur is to apply a Gaussian blur effect to an input image tensor.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· image: A torch.Tensor representing the input image to be blurred, with dimensions (batch_size, height, width, channels).
· blur_radius: An integer that specifies the radius of the blur effect. A value of 0 indicates no blurring will be applied.
· sigma: A float that represents the standard deviation of the Gaussian distribution used for generating the blur kernel. This controls the spread of the kernel values.

**Code Description**: The blur function begins by checking if the blur_radius is set to 0. If it is, the function returns the original image as a single-element tuple, indicating that no blurring is applied. 

If the blur_radius is greater than 0, the function proceeds to extract the dimensions of the input image tensor, which includes the batch size, height, width, and number of channels. It then calculates the kernel size for the Gaussian kernel based on the specified blur_radius, ensuring that the kernel size is always an odd integer.

The function calls the gaussian_kernel function to generate a Gaussian kernel with the calculated kernel size and the provided sigma value. This kernel is repeated for each channel of the image and reshaped appropriately for convolution operations.

Next, the function permutes the image tensor to match the expected input shape for PyTorch's convolution operations, which is (B, C, H, W). The image is then padded using reflection padding to accommodate the blur effect, ensuring that the edges of the image are handled correctly during convolution.

The blurred image is computed by applying a 2D convolution operation using the blurred kernel on the padded image. The output is then sliced to remove the padding, and the tensor is permuted back to its original shape of (B, H, W, C).

Finally, the function returns the blurred image as a single-element tuple.

This function is called by other functions in the project, specifically for image processing tasks that require a blurring effect. The gaussian_kernel function is critical here, as it provides the necessary kernel for the convolution operation, allowing the blur function to effectively apply the Gaussian blur to the input image.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the blur_radius is a non-negative integer. The sigma value should be chosen based on the desired level of blurriness, with larger values resulting in a more pronounced blur effect.

**Output Example**: A possible appearance of the code's return value for an input image tensor with dimensions (1, 256, 256, 3) after applying a blur with a blur_radius of 5 and sigma of 1.0 might look like the following tensor shape: (1, 256, 256, 3) containing the blurred pixel values.
***
## ClassDef Quantize
**Quantize**: The function of Quantize is to perform color quantization on images, reducing the number of colors in an image while allowing for various dithering techniques.

**attributes**: The attributes of this Class.
· INPUT_TYPES: A class method that defines the required input types for the quantization process, including the image, number of colors, and dithering method.
· RETURN_TYPES: A tuple indicating the type of output returned by the quantization function, which is an image.
· FUNCTION: A string that specifies the name of the function to be executed, which is "quantize".
· CATEGORY: A string that categorizes this class under "image/postprocessing".

**Code Description**: The Quantize class is designed to handle the process of color quantization for images. It includes an initializer that does not perform any specific action upon instantiation. The class method INPUT_TYPES defines the necessary inputs for the quantization process, which include an image of type "IMAGE", an integer specifying the number of colors (with a default of 256, a minimum of 1, and a maximum of 256), and a string for the dithering method, which can be one of several predefined options. The RETURN_TYPES attribute indicates that the output will be of type "IMAGE". The FUNCTION attribute specifies that the main function to be called for processing is "quantize". The CATEGORY attribute categorizes the class under image post-processing tasks.

The class contains two main methods: bayer and quantize. The bayer method implements the Bayer dithering algorithm, which is a technique used to create a dithered image by applying a Bayer matrix to the input image. This method first generates a normalized Bayer matrix based on the specified order, then applies this matrix to the input image to create a dithered effect. The quantize method is responsible for the overall quantization process. It takes a batch of images, the desired number of colors, and the dithering method as inputs. For each image in the batch, it converts the image from a tensor to a PIL Image, quantizes it using the specified number of colors, and applies the chosen dithering technique. The resulting quantized images are then converted back to tensors and returned as a batch.

**Note**: When using the quantize method, ensure that the input image tensor is in the correct format (batch size, height, width, channels) and that the colors parameter is within the specified range. The dither parameter must match one of the predefined options to avoid errors.

**Output Example**: The output of the quantize method will be a tuple containing a tensor of quantized images, where each image has been reduced to the specified number of colors and processed according to the chosen dithering method. For example, if the input image tensor has a shape of (2, 256, 256, 3) and the colors parameter is set to 16 with dithering set to "floyd-steinberg", the output might look like a tensor of shape (2, 256, 256, 3) containing the quantized color values for each image.
### FunctionDef __init__(self)

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· There are no parameters for this function.

**Code Description**: The __init__ function is a constructor method in Python, which is automatically called when an instance of the class is created. In this specific implementation, the function does not perform any operations as it contains only the `pass` statement. The `pass` statement is a placeholder that indicates that no action is taken. This means that the constructor does not initialize any attributes or perform any setup tasks when an instance of the class is instantiated. As a result, instances of this class will not have any predefined properties or behaviors upon creation.

**Note**: It is important to recognize that while this __init__ function does not perform any actions, it can be modified in the future to include initialization logic as needed. Additionally, even though the function is currently empty, its presence indicates that the class is designed to be extended or modified later.
***
### FunctionDef INPUT_TYPES(s)
**INPUT_TYPES**: The function of INPUT_TYPES is to define and return the required input types for a quantization process.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· s: This parameter is not utilized within the function body and serves as a placeholder for potential future use or for compatibility with a specific interface.

**Code Description**: The INPUT_TYPES function constructs and returns a dictionary that specifies the required input types for an image quantization operation. The returned dictionary contains a single key, "required", which maps to another dictionary detailing the expected inputs. 

1. **image**: This key expects a value of type "IMAGE", indicating that the input must be an image object.
2. **colors**: This key expects an integer value ("INT") that represents the number of colors to be used in the quantization process. The associated dictionary specifies constraints for this parameter:
   - **default**: The default value is set to 256, meaning if no value is provided, the function will assume 256 colors.
   - **min**: The minimum allowable value is 1, ensuring that at least one color is specified.
   - **max**: The maximum allowable value is 256, capping the number of colors to the standard limit for many quantization algorithms.
   - **step**: The step value is set to 1, indicating that the colors parameter can be incremented or decremented by one unit.
3. **dither**: This key expects a list of string options, allowing the user to choose a dithering method. The available options are:
   - "none"
   - "floyd-steinberg"
   - "bayer-2"
   - "bayer-4"
   - "bayer-8"
   - "bayer-16"

The function is designed to provide a structured way to define input requirements, ensuring that users of the quantization process understand what inputs are necessary and the constraints associated with them.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the inputs conform to the specified types and constraints to avoid errors during the quantization process. The function does not perform any validation on the inputs; it merely defines the expected structure.

**Output Example**: A possible appearance of the code's return value could be:
{
    "required": {
        "image": ("IMAGE",),
        "colors": ("INT", {
            "default": 256,
            "min": 1,
            "max": 256,
            "step": 1
        }),
        "dither": (["none", "floyd-steinberg", "bayer-2", "bayer-4", "bayer-8", "bayer-16"],),
    },

### FunctionDef bayer(im, pal_im, order)
**bayer**: The function of bayer is to apply a Bayer dithering algorithm to an image using a specified color palette and order.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· im: A PIL Image object representing the input image to be quantized.
· pal_im: A PIL Image object representing the color palette used for quantization.
· order: An integer representing the order of the Bayer matrix to be used for dithering.

**Code Description**: The bayer function implements a dithering technique based on the Bayer matrix to enhance the quantization of an image. It begins by defining a nested function, normalized_bayer_matrix, which recursively generates a normalized Bayer matrix of size 2^n x 2^n, where n is the order provided. The Bayer matrix is used to distribute the quantization error across the image, resulting in a visually appealing representation of the image with reduced color banding.

The function first calculates the number of colors in the provided palette and determines the spread factor based on this count. It then computes the Bayer matrix for the specified order and scales it accordingly. The input image is converted to a float tensor, and the Bayer matrix is tiled to match the dimensions of the image. The tiled matrix is added to the image tensor, and the result is clamped to ensure pixel values remain within the valid range of 0 to 255.

After processing, the resulting tensor is converted back to a PIL Image, and the quantization is applied using the provided palette without dithering. The final output is a quantized image that reflects the Bayer dithering effect.

The bayer function is called within the quantize method of the Quantize class. When the dither parameter is set to a value starting with "bayer", the quantize method extracts the order from the string and invokes the bayer function, passing the current image and palette. This integration allows for advanced dithering options when quantizing images, enhancing the overall quality of the output.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the input image is in RGB mode and that the palette image is properly defined before calling this function. The order parameter must be a power of two to generate a valid Bayer matrix.

**Output Example**: A possible appearance of the code's return value could be a quantized PIL Image object that visually represents the original image with a limited color palette, exhibiting a dithered effect that reduces color banding and enhances detail.
#### FunctionDef normalized_bayer_matrix(n)
**normalized_bayer_matrix**: The function of normalized_bayer_matrix is to generate a normalized Bayer matrix of a specified order.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· n: An integer representing the order of the Bayer matrix to be generated. It must be a non-negative integer.

**Code Description**: The normalized_bayer_matrix function constructs a normalized Bayer matrix recursively based on the input parameter n. If n is 0, the function returns a 1x1 matrix filled with zeros of type float32. For values of n greater than 0, the function calculates q as 4 raised to the power of n. It then recursively calls itself to obtain the matrix for n-1, denoted as m. The function then constructs a larger matrix using the smaller matrix m, applying specific transformations to its elements. The resulting matrix is formed by arranging four quadrants: the top-left quadrant is (m-1.5), the top-right quadrant is (m+0.5), the bottom-left quadrant is (m+1.5), and the bottom-right quadrant is (m-0.5). Finally, the entire matrix is divided by q to normalize it. This recursive approach allows for the generation of increasingly complex Bayer matrices as n increases.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the parameter n is a non-negative integer. The function will not handle negative values or non-integer types, which may lead to unexpected behavior or errors.

**Output Example**: For an input of n = 2, the function might return a 4x4 matrix structured as follows:
[[ -0.375,  0.125,  0.625,  1.125],
 [  0.625,  1.125,  1.625,  2.125],
 [  1.625,  2.125,  2.625,  3.125],
 [  2.625,  3.125,  3.625,  4.125]]

### FunctionDef quantize(self, image, colors, dither)
**quantize**: The function of quantize is to reduce the color depth of an image by applying a quantization process with optional dithering.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· image: A torch.Tensor representing the input image in the shape of (batch_size, height, width, channels), where channels should be 3 for RGB images.
· colors: An integer specifying the number of colors to be used in the quantization process.
· dither: A string indicating the dithering method to be applied. It can be "none", "floyd-steinberg", or "bayer" followed by an order number.

**Code Description**: The quantize function processes a batch of images to reduce their color depth while optionally applying dithering techniques to enhance visual quality. The function begins by extracting the dimensions of the input image tensor, initializing a result tensor of the same shape to store the quantized images.

For each image in the batch, the function converts the tensor representation of the image to a PIL Image object. It then creates a color palette image by quantizing the original image to the specified number of colors. Depending on the value of the dither parameter, the function applies different dithering techniques:

- If dither is set to "none", the quantization is performed without any dithering.
- If dither is set to "floyd-steinberg", the Floyd-Steinberg dithering method is applied during quantization.
- If dither starts with "bayer", the function extracts the order from the string and calls the bayer function, which implements the Bayer dithering algorithm.

After applying the chosen dithering method, the quantized image is converted back to a tensor and normalized to the range [0, 1]. The resulting quantized images are stored in the result tensor.

The quantize function is closely related to the bayer function, which is invoked when dithering is specified as a Bayer method. The bayer function enhances the quantization process by distributing quantization errors across the image using a Bayer matrix, resulting in improved visual quality.

**Note**: It is essential to ensure that the input image is in RGB format and that the colors parameter is set to a valid integer value representing the desired color palette size. The dither parameter must be a recognized option to avoid unexpected behavior.

**Output Example**: The output of the quantize function is a tuple containing a tensor of quantized images, where each image reflects the original image with a reduced color palette and may exhibit dithering effects based on the specified method. The tensor will have the same shape as the input image tensor.

## ClassDef Sharpen
**Sharpen**: The function of Sharpen is to apply a sharpening filter to an image.

**attributes**: The attributes of this Class.
· INPUT_TYPES: Defines the required input types for the sharpening function, including the image and parameters for sharpening.
· RETURN_TYPES: Specifies the return type of the function, which is an image.
· FUNCTION: The name of the function that performs the sharpening operation.
· CATEGORY: The category under which this class is organized, specifically for image post-processing.

**Code Description**: The Sharpen class is designed to enhance the sharpness of images through a convolution operation using a Gaussian kernel. The class contains an initializer method that does not take any parameters. The INPUT_TYPES class method specifies the required inputs for the sharpening operation, which include an image tensor, a sharpen radius (an integer), a sigma value (a float), and an alpha value (a float). Each of these parameters has defined constraints such as default values, minimum and maximum limits, and step increments.

The RETURN_TYPES attribute indicates that the output of the sharpening function will be an image. The FUNCTION attribute specifies that the method responsible for performing the sharpening operation is named "sharpen." The CATEGORY attribute categorizes this class under "image/postprocessing," indicating its purpose within the broader context of image manipulation.

The core functionality is implemented in the sharpen method, which takes an image tensor and the specified parameters. If the sharpen_radius is zero, the method returns the original image without any modifications. For non-zero sharpen_radius values, the method calculates the kernel size based on the sharpen_radius and generates a Gaussian kernel using the sigma value. The kernel is adjusted to ensure that the center value is modified appropriately to achieve the desired sharpening effect.

The image tensor is permuted to match the expected input format for the convolution operation, and padding is applied to handle edge cases during the convolution process. The sharpened image is obtained by applying the convolution operation with the generated kernel. Finally, the result is clamped to ensure pixel values remain within the valid range of [0, 1], and the method returns the sharpened image as a tuple.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the input image is in the correct format (a 4D tensor with shape [batch_size, height, width, channels]) before invoking the sharpen method. The parameters for sharpen_radius, sigma, and alpha should be chosen carefully to achieve the desired sharpening effect without introducing excessive noise or artifacts.

**Output Example**: A possible appearance of the code's return value could be a tensor representing a sharpened image, where pixel values are clamped between 0 and 1, maintaining the same shape as the input image tensor. For instance, if the input image tensor has a shape of (1, 256, 256, 3), the output will also have the shape (1, 256, 256, 3), but with enhanced sharpness.
### FunctionDef __init__(self)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize an instance of the class.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· parameter1: None

**Code Description**: The __init__ function is a constructor method in Python, which is automatically called when a new instance of the class is created. In this specific implementation, the function does not take any parameters other than the implicit 'self' parameter, which refers to the instance being created. The body of the function contains a single statement, `pass`, which indicates that no specific initialization actions are performed when an instance of the class is instantiated. This means that the class does not initialize any attributes or perform any setup tasks upon creation.

**Note**: Since this __init__ function does not perform any operations, it is effectively a placeholder. It is important to consider adding initialization logic if the class is intended to manage state or require specific setup during instantiation.
***
### FunctionDef INPUT_TYPES(s)
**INPUT_TYPES**: The function of INPUT_TYPES is to define and return the required input types for the sharpening process in image processing.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· s: This parameter is typically used to represent the state or context in which the function is called, although it is not utilized within the function body.

**Code Description**: The INPUT_TYPES function returns a dictionary that specifies the required input types for an image sharpening operation. The dictionary contains a single key, "required", which maps to another dictionary detailing the specific inputs needed for the function to operate correctly. 

The "image" key expects an input of type "IMAGE", indicating that the function requires an image to be processed. The "sharpen_radius" key is associated with an integer input ("INT") that has constraints defined by a dictionary. This dictionary specifies a default value of 1, a minimum value of 1, a maximum value of 31, and a step increment of 1. 

Similarly, the "sigma" key requires a floating-point number ("FLOAT") with a default of 1.0, a minimum of 0.1, a maximum of 10.0, and a step of 0.1. The "alpha" key also requires a floating-point number with a default of 1.0, a minimum of 0.0, a maximum of 5.0, and a step of 0.1. These constraints ensure that the inputs are validated and fall within acceptable ranges, which is crucial for the sharpening algorithm to function effectively.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the inputs provided to the function adhere to the specified types and constraints to avoid errors during processing. The function does not perform any validation itself; it merely defines the expected input structure.

**Output Example**: An example of the return value from the INPUT_TYPES function could look like this:
{
    "required": {
        "image": ("IMAGE",),
        "sharpen_radius": ("INT", {
            "default": 1,
            "min": 1,
            "max": 31,
            "step": 1
        }),
        "sigma": ("FLOAT", {
            "default": 1.0,
            "min": 0.1,
            "max": 10.0,
            "step": 0.1
        }),
        "alpha": ("FLOAT", {
            "default": 1.0,
            "min": 0.0,
            "max": 5.0,
            "step": 0.1
        }),
    },
}

### FunctionDef sharpen(self, image, sharpen_radius, sigma, alpha)
**sharpen**: The function of sharpen is to enhance the edges and details of an image by applying a sharpening filter.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· image: A torch.Tensor representing the input image in the format (batch_size, height, width, channels). It contains pixel values that the sharpening effect will be applied to.
· sharpen_radius: An integer that specifies the radius of the sharpening kernel. A value of 0 indicates that no sharpening will be performed.
· sigma: A float that represents the standard deviation of the Gaussian distribution used to create the sharpening kernel. It influences the spread of the kernel values.
· alpha: A float that controls the strength of the sharpening effect. Higher values result in a more pronounced sharpening effect.

**Code Description**: The sharpen function begins by checking if the sharpen_radius is set to 0. If it is, the function returns the original image without any modifications. If sharpening is to be performed, the function extracts the dimensions of the input image, including batch size, height, width, and number of channels. 

Next, it calculates the kernel size based on the sharpen_radius, which determines the dimensions of the Gaussian kernel used for sharpening. The gaussian_kernel function is called to generate this kernel, which is then adjusted to create a sharpening effect. Specifically, the center value of the kernel is modified by subtracting the sum of the kernel values and adding 1.0, ensuring that the kernel maintains a proper balance for sharpening.

The input image is then permuted to match the expected input format for the convolution operation, which is (batch_size, channels, height, width). The image is padded using reflection to accommodate the kernel size during convolution. The F.conv2d function is employed to apply the sharpening kernel to the padded image, and the result is cropped to remove the padding.

Finally, the sharpened image is permuted back to the original format and clamped to ensure that pixel values remain within the valid range of [0, 1]. The function returns the sharpened image as a tuple.

This function relies on the gaussian_kernel function to create the necessary kernel for the sharpening effect. The gaussian_kernel generates a Gaussian matrix that serves as the basis for the sharpening filter, which is then modified to enhance the edges of the image. The sharpen function is specifically designed to improve image clarity and detail, making it a valuable tool in image processing tasks.

**Note**: It is important to choose appropriate values for sharpen_radius, sigma, and alpha to achieve the desired sharpening effect without introducing excessive noise or artifacts in the image.

**Output Example**: A possible appearance of the code's return value for an input image could be a tensor representing the sharpened image with pixel values adjusted to enhance details, for instance:

```
tensor([[[0.1, 0.2, 0.3],
         [0.2, 0.3, 0.4],
         [0.3, 0.4, 0.5]],
         
        [[0.1, 0.2, 0.3],
         [0.2, 0.3, 0.4],
         [0.3, 0.4, 0.5]]])
```

## ClassDef ImageScaleToTotalPixels
**ImageScaleToTotalPixels**: The function of ImageScaleToTotalPixels is to upscale an image to a specified number of total pixels while allowing the selection of different upscaling methods.

**attributes**: The attributes of this Class.
· upscale_methods: A list of available methods for upscaling the image, including "nearest-exact", "bilinear", "area", "bicubic", and "lanczos".
· crop_methods: A list of available methods for cropping the image, including "disabled" and "center".
· INPUT_TYPES: A class method that defines the required input types for the upscaling function.
· RETURN_TYPES: A tuple indicating the return type of the function, which is an "IMAGE".
· FUNCTION: A string that specifies the name of the function to be called, which is "upscale".
· CATEGORY: A string that categorizes the functionality of the class, which is "image/upscaling".

**Code Description**: The ImageScaleToTotalPixels class is designed to facilitate the upscaling of images based on a specified target number of megapixels. The class contains predefined lists of upscaling methods and cropping methods that can be utilized during the image processing. The primary method, upscale, takes three parameters: an image, the chosen upscaling method, and the desired number of megapixels. 

When the upscale method is invoked, it first rearranges the dimensions of the input image tensor to prepare for processing. It calculates the total number of pixels based on the provided megapixels value, converting it into an integer representation. The scale factor is then determined by taking the square root of the ratio of the total pixel count to the current pixel count of the image. This scale factor is applied to compute the new width and height for the upscaled image.

The actual upscaling is performed using a utility function, common_upscale, which applies the specified upscaling method to the image samples. The processed image is then rearranged back to its original dimension order before being returned as the output.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the input image and the selected upscaling method are compatible. The megapixels parameter must be within the defined range of 0.01 to 16.0 to avoid errors during processing.

**Output Example**: The output of the upscale method will be a tuple containing the upscaled image tensor. For instance, if the input image is of size (3, 256, 256) and the target is set to 4.0 megapixels with the "bicubic" method, the output might resemble a tensor of size (3, 512, 512), representing the upscaled image.
### FunctionDef INPUT_TYPES(s)
**INPUT_TYPES**: The function of INPUT_TYPES is to define the required input types for a specific processing function related to image scaling.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· parameter1: s - An object that contains the available upscale methods.

**Code Description**: The INPUT_TYPES function returns a dictionary that specifies the required input types for an image processing operation. The dictionary consists of a single key, "required", which maps to another dictionary containing three keys: "image", "upscale_method", and "megapixels". 

- The "image" key expects a value of type "IMAGE", indicating that an image input is necessary for the function to operate.
- The "upscale_method" key retrieves its value from the "upscale_methods" attribute of the input parameter 's'. This allows for flexibility in specifying different methods for upscaling the image.
- The "megapixels" key is defined as a tuple containing the type "FLOAT" and a dictionary that specifies additional constraints: a default value of 1.0, a minimum value of 0.01, a maximum value of 16.0, and a step increment of 0.01. This ensures that the megapixel input is a floating-point number within the specified range and adheres to the defined step size.

Overall, this function is crucial for validating and structuring the inputs required for image processing tasks, ensuring that users provide the correct types and values.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the input values conform to the specified types and constraints to avoid errors during processing. The function assumes that the object 's' has been properly initialized and contains the necessary upscale methods.

**Output Example**: A possible appearance of the code's return value could be:
{
    "required": {
        "image": ("IMAGE",),
        "upscale_method": ("BILINEAR", "BICUBIC", "NEAREST"),
        "megapixels": ("FLOAT", {"default": 1.0, "min": 0.01, "max": 16.0, "step": 0.01}),
    }
}
***
### FunctionDef upscale(self, image, upscale_method, megapixels)
**upscale**: The function of upscale is to resize an image tensor to a specified number of megapixels using a chosen upscaling method.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· image: A tensor representing the input image, which is expected to have a specific shape for processing.  
· upscale_method: A string indicating the method used for upscaling, which can be "bislerp", "lanczos", or any other valid mode supported by PyTorch's interpolation function.  
· megapixels: A float representing the target size in megapixels to which the image should be scaled.

**Code Description**: The upscale function begins by rearranging the dimensions of the input image tensor using the movedim method, which changes the order of the dimensions to facilitate processing. Specifically, it moves the last dimension to the second position, resulting in a tensor shape that is more suitable for subsequent operations.

Next, the function calculates the total number of pixels that the image should have based on the provided megapixels parameter. This is done by multiplying the megapixels value by 1024 squared, converting it to the total pixel count.

The scale factor is then computed by taking the square root of the ratio of the total pixel count to the product of the height and width of the image tensor. This scale factor is used to determine the new dimensions for the image. The width and height are rounded to the nearest integer values to ensure they are valid dimensions for the image.

The function then calls the common_upscale function, passing the modified image tensor along with the newly calculated width, height, and the specified upscale method. The common_upscale function is responsible for performing the actual resizing of the image based on the chosen interpolation method.

After the upscaling operation, the resulting tensor is rearranged back to its original dimension order using movedim again, ensuring that the output tensor has the correct shape for further processing.

Finally, the function returns a tuple containing the upscaled image tensor.

This function is typically utilized in workflows that require image resizing before further processing, such as in machine learning models or image analysis tasks. By modularizing the upscaling process, it allows for flexibility in choosing different upscaling methods while maintaining a consistent interface for image processing.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the input image tensor is in the correct shape and data type before calling the upscale function. The function assumes that the input tensor is compatible with the operations performed within it.

**Output Example**: Given an input tensor of shape (1, 3, 256, 256) representing a single image with 3 color channels and a size of 256x256, calling upscale with upscale_method="bislerp" and megapixels=1 would return a tensor of shape (1, 3, 1024, 1024) containing the resized image data.
