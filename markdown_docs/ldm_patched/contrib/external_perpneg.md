## ClassDef PerpNeg
**PerpNeg**: The function of PerpNeg is to apply a patching technique to a model using negative conditioning and scaling.

**attributes**: The attributes of this Class.
· INPUT_TYPES: Defines the input types required for the patching process, including the model, empty conditioning, and negative scale.
· RETURN_TYPES: Specifies the return type of the patch method, which is a model.
· FUNCTION: Indicates the name of the method that performs the main functionality, which is "patch".
· CATEGORY: Categorizes the class under "_for_testing".

**Code Description**: The PerpNeg class is designed to modify a given model by applying a patch that incorporates negative conditioning. The class contains a class method `INPUT_TYPES` that specifies the required inputs for the patching process. These inputs include a model of type "MODEL", an empty conditioning of type "CONDITIONING", and a negative scale of type "FLOAT" with a default value of 1.0 and constraints on its range (minimum of 0.0 and maximum of 100.0). 

The `patch` method takes three parameters: `model`, `empty_conditioning`, and `neg_scale`. Within this method, the model is cloned to create a new instance, and the empty conditioning is converted into a format suitable for processing. A nested function `cfg_function` is defined to handle the core logic of the patching process. This function takes a dictionary of arguments, including the model, noise predictions, input data, and model options.

Inside `cfg_function`, the model's extra conditions are processed using the negative conditioning. The noise predictions for both conditioned and unconditioned inputs are calculated. The method then computes the positive and negative noise predictions by subtracting the unconditioned noise prediction from the conditioned one. A perpendicular adjustment is calculated based on the product of the positive and negative predictions, normalized by the square of the negative prediction's norm. This adjustment is scaled by the provided negative scale.

Finally, the function combines the unconditioned noise prediction with a scaled difference of the positive prediction and the perpendicular adjustment, resulting in a final output that is derived from the original input. The modified model is then set with this configuration function, and the method returns a tuple containing the modified model.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the inputs provided to the `patch` method adhere to the specified types and constraints to avoid runtime errors. The negative scale should be carefully chosen to achieve the desired effect on the model's output.

**Output Example**: A possible return value of the `patch` method could be a modified model instance that has been adjusted based on the negative conditioning and scaling, ready for further processing or evaluation.
### FunctionDef INPUT_TYPES(s)
**INPUT_TYPES**: The function of INPUT_TYPES is to define and return a structured dictionary of required input types for a specific model configuration.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· parameter1: s - This parameter is not utilized within the function and serves as a placeholder for potential future use or for maintaining a consistent function signature.

**Code Description**: The INPUT_TYPES function constructs and returns a dictionary that specifies the required input types for a model. The returned dictionary contains a single key "required", which maps to another dictionary that defines three specific input parameters: "model", "empty_conditioning", and "neg_scale". 

- "model": This input is expected to be of type "MODEL". It is a required parameter that likely specifies the type of model to be used.
- "empty_conditioning": This input is expected to be of type "CONDITIONING". It is also a required parameter, which may refer to the conditioning input necessary for the model's operation.
- "neg_scale": This input is expected to be of type "FLOAT". It is a required parameter with additional constraints: it has a default value of 1.0, a minimum value of 0.0, and a maximum value of 100.0. This parameter likely controls the scaling factor for negative inputs or conditions within the model.

The function is designed to ensure that the necessary inputs are clearly defined and validated, providing a structured approach to input management in the context of model configuration.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the inputs provided to the model adhere to the specified types and constraints to avoid runtime errors or unexpected behavior. The function does not handle any validation or error-checking for the inputs; it simply defines the expected structure.

**Output Example**: A possible appearance of the code's return value could be:
{
    "required": {
        "model": ("MODEL", ),
        "empty_conditioning": ("CONDITIONING", ),
        "neg_scale": ("FLOAT", {"default": 1.0, "min": 0.0, "max": 100.0})
    }
}

### FunctionDef patch(self, model, empty_conditioning, neg_scale)
**patch**: The function of patch is to modify a given model by applying a custom sampling configuration based on conditioning inputs and noise predictions.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· model: An instance of the model to be modified, which is expected to have a method for cloning and setting a sampling configuration function.
· empty_conditioning: A list of tuples representing conditioning data that will be converted into a standardized format for processing.
· neg_scale: A scaling factor used to adjust the negative perturbation in the sampling process.

**Code Description**: The patch function begins by cloning the provided model to create a separate instance that can be modified without affecting the original model. It then utilizes the convert_cond function from the ldm_patched.modules.sample module to transform the empty_conditioning input into a standardized format suitable for further processing. This transformation is crucial as it prepares the conditioning data for subsequent calculations.

Within the patch function, a nested cfg_function is defined, which takes a dictionary of arguments that include the model, noise predictions, input data, and other relevant parameters. This function is responsible for calculating the adjusted noise predictions based on both positive and negative conditioning inputs.

The cfg_function processes the conditioning data by encoding the model's extra conditions along with the transformed nocond data. It then computes the noise predictions for both conditioned and unconditioned inputs using the calc_cond_uncond_batch function. The results are used to derive the positive and negative perturbations, which are then combined to calculate a corrective term (perp_neg) that is scaled by the neg_scale parameter.

Finally, the cfg_function computes the final result by adjusting the input data based on the calculated noise predictions and the conditioning scale. This result is returned to the caller of the cfg_function.

The patch function concludes by setting the cfg_function as the model's sampling configuration function, allowing the model to utilize this custom logic during sampling operations. The function returns a tuple containing the modified model instance.

This function is integral to the PerpNeg class, as it enables the application of sophisticated sampling techniques that leverage conditioning data to enhance the model's performance in generating outputs.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the empty_conditioning input is correctly formatted as a list of tuples, as improper formatting may lead to errors during processing. Additionally, the neg_scale parameter should be chosen carefully to achieve the desired effect on the negative perturbation.

**Output Example**: The output of the patch function is a tuple containing the modified model instance, which can be utilized in subsequent operations. An example of the return value might look like this:
```python
(modified_model_instance,)
```
#### FunctionDef cfg_function(args)
**cfg_function**: The function of cfg_function is to compute a modified input tensor based on conditional and unconditional noise predictions from a model.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· args: A dictionary containing the following keys:
  - model: The model used for generating predictions.
  - cond_denoised: The tensor representing the positive noise predictions.
  - uncond_denoised: The tensor representing the negative noise predictions.
  - cond_scale: A scaling factor applied to the conditional predictions.
  - input: The input tensor that serves as the base for the computation.
  - sigma: A tensor representing the noise level.
  - model_options: A dictionary containing additional options for the model.

**Code Description**: The cfg_function takes a dictionary of arguments and performs several computations to generate a modified input tensor. Initially, it extracts the necessary components from the args dictionary, including the model, noise predictions, input tensor, and scaling factors. 

The function begins by processing the model's extra conditions using the encode_model_conds function. This function encodes the conditions based on the model's requirements, preparing them for further processing. The nocond variable, which is not explicitly defined in the provided code, is assumed to represent a set of conditions that do not include any specific conditioning.

Next, the function calls calc_cond_uncond_batch, which processes the encoded conditions and the input tensor. This function returns the noise predictions for the unconditional case, which are then used to compute the positive and negative noise predictions by subtracting the unconditional predictions from the respective conditional predictions.

The function calculates the perpendicular component (perp) using the positive and negative noise predictions. This is done by taking the element-wise product of the positive and negative predictions, summing the results, and normalizing it with the squared norm of the negative predictions. The perp_neg is then scaled by a variable (neg_scale), which is not defined in the provided code but is assumed to be a scaling factor for the negative component.

Finally, the cfg_result is computed by combining the unconditional noise predictions with the scaled difference between the positive predictions and the perpendicular negative predictions. The final output is obtained by subtracting cfg_result from the input tensor, yielding the modified input tensor that incorporates the effects of the noise predictions.

This function plays a crucial role in the overall processing pipeline, as it integrates the results from the encode_model_conds and calc_cond_uncond_batch functions to produce a refined output that can be used in subsequent model operations.

**Note**: It is essential to ensure that the input tensor and conditions provided in the args dictionary are correctly structured to avoid runtime errors. The function assumes that the model is properly configured and that the necessary conditions are available for processing.

**Output Example**: A possible return value of the function could be a tensor representing the modified input, such as:
```
<modified_input_tensor_shape>
```
