## FunctionDef append_zero(x)
**append_zero**: The function of append_zero is to concatenate a tensor with a new zero tensor of size one.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· x: A tensor of any shape, which will be concatenated with a new zero tensor.

**Code Description**: The append_zero function takes a tensor `x` as input and uses the PyTorch library to concatenate it with a new tensor filled with zeros of size one. The function utilizes `torch.cat`, which is a PyTorch function that concatenates a sequence of tensors along a specified dimension. In this case, it concatenates the input tensor `x` with a new tensor created by `x.new_zeros([1])`, which generates a tensor of zeros with the same data type and device as `x`. This function is particularly useful in scenarios where a noise schedule needs to be extended by adding an initial value of zero, which is a common requirement in various sampling techniques.

The append_zero function is called by several other functions within the same module, specifically get_sigmas_karras, get_sigmas_exponential, get_sigmas_polyexponential, and get_sigmas_vp. Each of these functions constructs different types of noise schedules and utilizes append_zero to ensure that the resulting tensor includes an additional zero at the end. This is crucial for maintaining consistency in the shape of the output tensors, especially when these tensors are used in subsequent computations or algorithms that expect a specific dimensionality.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the input tensor `x` is appropriately defined and is on the correct device (CPU or GPU) before calling append_zero, as the function will inherit the device properties from `x`.

**Output Example**: If the input tensor `x` is a 1D tensor like `torch.tensor([1.0, 2.0, 3.0])`, the return value of append_zero would be `torch.tensor([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 0.0])`.
## FunctionDef get_sigmas_karras(n, sigma_min, sigma_max, rho, device)

· device: A string (default is 'cpu') specifying the device on which to create the tensors (e.g., 'cpu' or 'cuda').

**Code Description**: The get_sigmas_karras function generates a noise schedule based on the principles outlined by Karras et al. (2022). It begins by creating a linear ramp tensor that spans from 0 to 1 with a length of n, which is defined by the user. The function then calculates the inverse of the minimum and maximum sigma values raised to the power of rho. Using these values, it constructs a tensor of sigmas that transitions smoothly from sigma_max to sigma_min according to the specified rho parameter. The resulting tensor is then passed to the append_zero function, which appends a zero to the end of the tensor, ensuring that the output includes an additional value of zero. This is particularly important in sampling processes where an initial state is often represented by zero noise.

The get_sigmas_karras function is called by several other functions within the project, including get_sigmas in the KarrasScheduler class, sample_restart, calculate_sigmas_scheduler, and calculate_sigmas_scheduler_hacked. Each of these functions utilizes the noise schedule generated by get_sigmas_karras to facilitate various sampling techniques and algorithms. For instance, in the sample_restart function, the noise schedule is used to determine the steps for restarting the sampling process, while in the calculate_sigmas_scheduler functions, it helps to select the appropriate noise schedule based on the specified scheduler name.

**Note**: When using get_sigmas_karras, it is essential to ensure that the input parameters are correctly defined, particularly the device parameter, which should match the intended computation environment (CPU or GPU).

**Output Example**: If the function is called with parameters n=5, sigma_min=0.1, sigma_max=1.0, rho=7.0, and device='cpu', a possible return value could be a tensor like `tensor([0.0000, 0.1000, 0.3000, 0.6000, 1.0000, 0.0000])`, where the last value is the appended zero.
## FunctionDef get_sigmas_exponential(n, sigma_min, sigma_max, device)
**get_sigmas_exponential**: The function of get_sigmas_exponential is to construct an exponential noise schedule.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· n: An integer representing the number of sigma values to generate in the schedule.  
· sigma_min: A float that specifies the minimum value of sigma in the schedule.  
· sigma_max: A float that specifies the maximum value of sigma in the schedule.  
· device: A string that indicates the device to be used for tensor operations, defaulting to 'cpu'.

**Code Description**: The get_sigmas_exponential function generates a sequence of sigma values that follow an exponential distribution between a specified minimum (sigma_min) and maximum (sigma_max) value. It utilizes the PyTorch library to create a linearly spaced tensor in the logarithmic scale between the logarithms of sigma_max and sigma_min, which is then exponentiated to obtain the actual sigma values. The function finally appends a zero value to the end of the generated tensor by calling the append_zero function, ensuring that the output tensor has an additional zero at the end, which is often required in various sampling techniques.

This function is called by other components within the project, specifically by the get_sigmas method of the ExponentialScheduler class in the external_custom_sampler module, as well as by the calculate_sigmas_scheduler and calculate_sigmas_scheduler_hacked functions in the samplers module. These calling functions utilize get_sigmas_exponential to obtain the necessary sigma values for different scheduling strategies, indicating its role in the broader context of noise scheduling and sampling processes.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the input parameters, particularly the device, are correctly specified to match the intended computational environment (CPU or GPU) to avoid potential runtime errors.

**Output Example**: If the input parameters are n=5, sigma_min=0.1, and sigma_max=1.0, the return value of get_sigmas_exponential might be a tensor like `torch.tensor([0.1, 0.215, 0.462, 1.0, 0.0])`, where the last element is the appended zero.
## FunctionDef get_sigmas_polyexponential(n, sigma_min, sigma_max, rho, device)
**get_sigmas_polyexponential**: The function of get_sigmas_polyexponential is to construct a polynomial in log sigma noise schedule.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· n: An integer representing the number of sigma values to generate.  
· sigma_min: A float that specifies the minimum sigma value.  
· sigma_max: A float that specifies the maximum sigma value.  
· rho: A float (default is 1.0) that controls the shape of the polynomial ramp.  
· device: A string (default is 'cpu') that indicates the device on which to create the tensors (e.g., 'cpu' or 'cuda').

**Code Description**: The get_sigmas_polyexponential function generates a sequence of sigma values that follow a polynomial schedule in the logarithmic space. It begins by creating a ramp tensor that linearly decreases from 1 to 0 over `n` steps, raised to the power of `rho`. This ramp is then used to interpolate between the logarithm of `sigma_max` and `sigma_min`, effectively creating a logarithmic scale of sigma values. The resulting tensor of sigma values is then exponentiated to convert it back from the logarithmic scale to the original scale. Finally, the function calls append_zero to concatenate a zero tensor to the end of the sigma values, ensuring that the output tensor has an additional zero value, which is often required in noise scheduling for various sampling techniques.

This function is called by the get_sigmas method of the PolyexponentialScheduler class in the external_custom_sampler module. The get_sigmas method utilizes get_sigmas_polyexponential to obtain the sigma values needed for its operations, passing the number of steps, minimum and maximum sigma values, and the rho parameter. This indicates that get_sigmas_polyexponential plays a crucial role in generating the noise schedule that the PolyexponentialScheduler relies on for its sampling processes.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the input parameters, especially `n`, `sigma_min`, and `sigma_max`, are appropriately defined to avoid any runtime errors. Additionally, the device parameter should match the intended computational environment (CPU or GPU) to ensure optimal performance.

**Output Example**: If the input parameters are n=5, sigma_min=0.1, sigma_max=1.0, and rho=1.0, the return value of get_sigmas_polyexponential might look like a tensor such as `torch.tensor([0.1, 0.275, 0.615, 0.866, 1.0, 0.0])`.
## FunctionDef get_sigmas_vp(n, beta_d, beta_min, eps_s, device)
**get_sigmas_vp**: The function of get_sigmas_vp is to construct a continuous VP noise schedule.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· n: An integer representing the number of time steps for which the noise schedule is to be generated.  
· beta_d: A float that controls the diffusion rate, with a default value of 19.9.  
· beta_min: A float that sets the minimum value for the beta parameter, with a default value of 0.1.  
· eps_s: A small float value used to define the lower bound of the time steps, with a default value of 1e-3.  
· device: A string that specifies the device on which the computation will be performed, with a default value of 'cpu'.

**Code Description**: The get_sigmas_vp function generates a tensor representing a noise schedule based on a continuous variable process. It utilizes the PyTorch library to create a linearly spaced tensor `t` that ranges from 1 to `eps_s`, consisting of `n` points. The function then computes the sigmas using the formula derived from a diffusion process, specifically calculating the square root of the exponential function involving `beta_d` and `beta_min`. The resulting tensor of sigmas is then passed to the append_zero function, which appends a zero value to the end of the tensor. This ensures that the output tensor has a consistent shape, which is essential for subsequent operations in various sampling algorithms.

The get_sigmas_vp function is called by the get_sigmas method within the VPScheduler class located in the external_custom_sampler module. This method serves as an interface to obtain the sigmas for a specified number of steps and parameters, effectively integrating the noise schedule generation into the broader sampling framework.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the input parameters are correctly defined and that the specified device is available for computation. The function is designed to work seamlessly with both CPU and GPU environments, depending on the user's setup.

**Output Example**: If the input parameter `n` is set to 5, the function might return a tensor similar to `torch.tensor([sigma_1, sigma_2, sigma_3, sigma_4, sigma_5, 0.0])`, where each `sigma_i` represents the computed noise value for the corresponding time step.
## FunctionDef to_d(x, sigma, denoised)
**to_d**: The function of to_d is to convert a denoiser output to a Karras ODE derivative.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· parameter1: x - A tensor representing the current state or input to the denoising model.  
· parameter2: sigma - A tensor representing the noise level associated with the input tensor x.  
· parameter3: denoised - A tensor representing the output from the denoising model, which is the denoised version of the input tensor x.

**Code Description**: The to_d function computes the Karras ODE derivative by normalizing the difference between the input tensor x and the denoised output tensor. The mathematical operation performed is (x - denoised) / utils.append_dims(sigma, x.ndim). Here, the function first calculates the difference between the input tensor x and the denoised tensor. This difference is then divided by the sigma tensor, which has been adjusted to match the number of dimensions of x using the append_dims function from the utils module.

The append_dims function is crucial in this context as it ensures that the sigma tensor has the same number of dimensions as the input tensor x, allowing for proper element-wise division. This normalization step is essential for maintaining the consistency of the mathematical operations involved in the Karras ODE framework.

The to_d function is called within several sampling functions, such as sample_euler, sample_euler_ancestral, sample_heun, and others. In these functions, to_d is used to compute the derivative that will be applied to update the state of the tensor x during the sampling process. Each of these sampling methods utilizes the output of to_d to determine how to adjust the current state based on the denoised output and the noise level, thereby facilitating the denoising process in a structured manner.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the input tensor x and the sigma tensor are compatible in terms of dimensions; otherwise, the operations may lead to runtime errors. Users should also be aware that the behavior of the function relies on the proper functioning of the append_dims utility, particularly when handling tensors with varying dimensions.

**Output Example**: For an input tensor x with shape (3, 4) and a denoised tensor of the same shape, along with a sigma tensor of shape (3, 1), the output of to_d would be a tensor with shape (3, 4) representing the normalized derivative of the denoised output with respect to the input tensor.
## FunctionDef get_ancestral_step(sigma_from, sigma_to, eta)
**get_ancestral_step**: The function of get_ancestral_step is to calculate the noise levels for stepping down and the amount of noise to add during an ancestral sampling step.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· sigma_from: A float representing the initial noise level before the step.
· sigma_to: A float representing the target noise level after the step.
· eta: A float (default is 1.0) that controls the amount of noise added during the step.

**Code Description**: The get_ancestral_step function computes two key values during the ancestral sampling process: `sigma_down` and `sigma_up`. The `sigma_down` value indicates the noise level to which the process will step down, while `sigma_up` represents the amount of noise to be added to the sampled output. 

The function begins by checking if `eta` is zero. If it is, the function returns `sigma_to` as `sigma_down` and zero for `sigma_up`, indicating no noise will be added. If `eta` is non-zero, the function calculates `sigma_up` using a formula that incorporates both `sigma_from` and `sigma_to`. This formula ensures that the noise added is proportional to the difference in noise levels, scaled by `eta`. Subsequently, `sigma_down` is computed as the square root of the difference between the squares of `sigma_to` and `sigma_up`, ensuring that the resulting noise levels are valid.

The relationship of this function with its callers is significant. It is invoked by several sampling functions, including `sample_euler_ancestral`, `sample_dpm_2_ancestral`, `sample_dpmpp_2s_ancestral`, and others. Each of these functions relies on the outputs of `get_ancestral_step` to determine how to adjust the noise levels during the sampling process. For instance, in `sample_euler_ancestral`, the function is called to obtain the noise levels before applying the Euler method for sampling. Similarly, in `sample_dpm_2_ancestral`, it is used to adjust the noise levels for the DPM-Solver second-order steps. This highlights the importance of `get_ancestral_step` in ensuring that the sampling process is executed correctly and efficiently across different methods.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the `eta` parameter is set appropriately, as it directly influences the amount of noise added during the sampling process. A value of zero for `eta` will result in no noise being added, which may not be desirable in most sampling scenarios.

**Output Example**: An example output of the function could be:
```python
sigma_down, sigma_up = get_ancestral_step(0.5, 0.2, eta=0.8)
# This might return: (0.1414213562373095, 0.1414213562373095)
```
## FunctionDef default_noise_sampler(x)
**default_noise_sampler**: The function of default_noise_sampler is to create a noise sampling function based on the input tensor.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· x: A tensor that serves as the reference for the shape of the noise to be generated.

**Code Description**: The default_noise_sampler function takes a tensor x as input and returns a lambda function that generates random noise with the same shape as x. This noise is generated using the PyTorch function torch.randn_like, which creates a tensor filled with random numbers from a standard normal distribution (mean 0, variance 1) that matches the shape of the input tensor x. The returned lambda function takes two parameters, sigma and sigma_next, but these parameters are not utilized within the function itself. The primary purpose of this function is to provide a convenient way to generate noise that can be used in various sampling methods.

The default_noise_sampler function is called in several other functions within the same module, including sample_euler_ancestral, sample_dpm_2_ancestral, dpm_solver_fast, dpm_solver_adaptive, sample_dpmpp_2s_ancestral, generic_step_sampler, sample_lcm, and sample_tcd. In these functions, if a noise_sampler is not provided as an argument, default_noise_sampler is invoked with the input tensor x to create a noise sampling function. This ensures that all these sampling methods have access to a consistent noise generation mechanism, which is crucial for the stochastic processes involved in sampling.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the input tensor x is properly initialized before passing it to the default_noise_sampler function, as the shape of x determines the shape of the generated noise.

**Output Example**: An example of the output from invoking the returned lambda function could look like this:
```python
noise_function = default_noise_sampler(torch.tensor([[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0]]))
noise = noise_function(sigma=0.5, sigma_next=1.0)
# noise would be a tensor of the same shape as the input tensor, filled with random values.
```
## ClassDef BatchedBrownianTree
**BatchedBrownianTree**: The function of BatchedBrownianTree is to provide a wrapper around the torchsde.BrownianTree that enables the handling of batches of entropy.

**attributes**: The attributes of this Class.
· x: The initial state or input tensor for the Brownian tree process.  
· t0: The starting time for the Brownian motion.  
· t1: The ending time for the Brownian motion.  
· seed: The random seed or seeds used for generating the Brownian motion.  
· cpu_tree: A boolean indicating whether the Brownian trees should be created on the CPU.  
· sign: A value indicating the order of t0 and t1 after sorting.  
· batched: A boolean indicating whether the input is batched or not.  
· trees: A list of BrownianTree instances created based on the provided seeds.

**Code Description**: The BatchedBrownianTree class is designed to facilitate the generation of multiple Brownian motion paths in a batched manner. It initializes with parameters for the initial state (x), the time interval (t0, t1), and an optional random seed. The constructor sorts the time parameters and checks if the input is batched by examining the length of the seed. If the input is not batched, it converts the seed into a list containing a single element. The class utilizes the torchsde.BrownianTree to create instances of Brownian trees based on the provided parameters. Depending on the cpu_tree attribute, it either creates these instances on the CPU or retains them on the default device.

The class also includes a static method, sort, which ensures that the time parameters are ordered correctly and returns a sign indicating their order. The __call__ method allows instances of BatchedBrownianTree to be invoked directly, generating the Brownian motion paths for the specified time interval. It handles both batched and non-batched cases, returning the appropriate output based on the input format.

This class is utilized by the BrownianTreeNoiseSampler and BrownianTreeNoiseSamplerPatched classes in the project. In the BrownianTreeNoiseSampler, an instance of BatchedBrownianTree is created during initialization, where it takes the transformed sigma_min and sigma_max values as the time parameters. Similarly, in the global_init function of BrownianTreeNoiseSamplerPatched, BatchedBrownianTree is instantiated with the transformed time parameters, allowing for the generation of Brownian motion paths that are essential for noise sampling in diffusion processes.

**Note**: When using the BatchedBrownianTree class, ensure that the input tensor x and the time parameters t0 and t1 are appropriately defined. The seed parameter can be a single integer or a list of integers, depending on whether you are working with batched inputs or not.

**Output Example**: A possible appearance of the code's return value when calling an instance of BatchedBrownianTree could be a tensor representing the generated Brownian motion paths, such as:
```
tensor([[0.1, 0.2, 0.3],
        [0.4, 0.5, 0.6],
        [0.7, 0.8, 0.9]])
```
### FunctionDef __init__(self, x, t0, t1, seed)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize an instance of the BatchedBrownianTree class with specified parameters.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· parameter1: x - A tensor representing the initial state or configuration for the Brownian tree.
· parameter2: t0 - A tensor representing the starting time for the Brownian motion.
· parameter3: t1 - A tensor representing the ending time for the Brownian motion.
· parameter4: seed - An optional parameter that specifies the random seed for generating Brownian paths. If not provided, a random seed will be generated.
· parameter5: **kwargs - Additional keyword arguments that can be passed to customize the behavior of the Brownian tree.

**Code Description**: The __init__ method is responsible for setting up the BatchedBrownianTree instance. It begins by initializing a boolean attribute `cpu_tree` to True, which indicates whether the computations will be performed on the CPU. If the keyword argument "cpu" is provided, its value will override the default setting.

The method then calls the `sort` function to order the time parameters t0 and t1, ensuring that t0 is less than or equal to t1. The `sort` function also returns a sign indicating the original order of the parameters, which is stored in the instance variable `self.sign`.

Next, the method retrieves the initial state `w0` from the keyword arguments, defaulting to a tensor of zeros with the same shape as `x` if not provided. If the seed is not specified, a random integer seed is generated. The method checks if the seed is a list and adjusts the `batched` attribute accordingly, allowing for either batched or single-instance processing.

Depending on the value of `cpu_tree`, the method initializes a list of BrownianTree instances from the torchsde library. If `cpu_tree` is True, the tensors t0, w0, and t1 are moved to the CPU before being passed to the BrownianTree constructor. Otherwise, they are used as-is. This flexibility allows the BatchedBrownianTree to operate efficiently on either CPU or GPU, depending on the user's needs.

The __init__ method ensures that the BatchedBrownianTree is properly configured for subsequent operations, including the generation of Brownian paths based on the specified parameters.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the input tensors x, t0, and t1 are of compatible shapes and types. Additionally, the seed parameter should be handled carefully to avoid type errors, especially when it is expected to be a list. The method is designed to facilitate both single and batched operations, providing flexibility in usage.
***
### FunctionDef sort(a, b)
**sort**: The function of sort is to compare two values and return them in ascending order along with a sign indicating their relative order.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· parameter1: a - The first value to be compared.
· parameter2: b - The second value to be compared.

**Code Description**: The sort function takes two parameters, a and b, and evaluates their values. It returns a tuple containing the two values in ascending order, along with an integer sign that indicates their original order. If a is less than b, the function returns (a, b, 1), indicating that a comes before b. Conversely, if a is greater than or equal to b, it returns (b, a, -1), indicating that b comes before a. 

This function is utilized within the BatchedBrownianTree class, specifically in its __init__ and __call__ methods. In the __init__ method, the sort function is called to determine the order of the parameters t0 and t1, which represent time values. The sorted values are then assigned back to t0 and t1, and the sign of their order is stored in the instance variable self.sign. This ensures that the time values are consistently ordered for subsequent operations.

In the __call__ method, the sort function is again invoked to ensure that the time values t0 and t1 are in the correct order before they are used in calculations involving Brownian trees. The sign obtained from the sort function is used to adjust the output based on the original order of t0 and t1, ensuring that the results reflect the intended temporal relationship.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the inputs to the sort function are comparable; otherwise, a TypeError may occur. The function is designed to work with numerical values.

**Output Example**: For inputs sort(3, 5), the output would be (3, 5, 1). For inputs sort(5, 3), the output would be (3, 5, -1).
***
### FunctionDef __call__(self, t0, t1)
**__call__**: The function of __call__ is to compute and return the weighted output of Brownian trees based on two time parameters.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· parameter1: t0 - The first time value to be used in the computation.  
· parameter2: t1 - The second time value to be used in the computation.

**Code Description**: The __call__ method is designed to facilitate the computation of weighted outputs from a collection of Brownian trees, which are represented by the instance variable self.trees. The method begins by invoking the sort function to ensure that the two time parameters, t0 and t1, are ordered correctly. This is crucial as the order of these time values affects the calculations performed later in the method.

Once the time values are sorted, the method checks if the computation should be performed on the CPU or not by evaluating the boolean attribute self.cpu_tree. If self.cpu_tree is True, the method converts t0 and t1 to CPU tensors, ensuring they are in float format before passing them to each tree in self.trees. The results from each tree are then stacked into a single tensor, which is subsequently multiplied by the product of self.sign and the sign returned from the sort function. This multiplication adjusts the output based on the original order of t0 and t1.

If self.cpu_tree is False, the method directly computes the outputs using the original t0 and t1 tensors without converting them to CPU format. The output is again stacked and adjusted in the same manner.

Finally, the method returns the computed tensor. If the attribute self.batched is set to False, it returns only the first element of the stacked tensor, effectively providing a single output rather than a batch.

This method is integral to the functionality of the BatchedBrownianTree class, allowing it to leverage the properties of Brownian motion in a batched manner, which is essential for efficient computations in probabilistic modeling and simulations.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the inputs t0 and t1 are compatible with the operations performed within the method. Additionally, the method assumes that self.trees is a collection of callable objects that can accept the time parameters and return appropriate outputs.

**Output Example**: For inputs __call__(0.0, 1.0), the output might be a tensor representing the computed values from the Brownian trees, such as tensor([0.5, 1.2, -0.3]).

## ClassDef BrownianTreeNoiseSampler
**BrownianTreeNoiseSampler**: The function of BrownianTreeNoiseSampler is to generate noise samples using a Brownian tree process, which is particularly useful in stochastic differential equations for sampling in diffusion models.

**attributes**: The attributes of this Class.
· x: A Tensor that defines the shape, device, and dtype for generating random samples.
· sigma_min: A float representing the low end of the valid interval for the noise.
· sigma_max: A float representing the high end of the valid interval for the noise.
· seed: An integer or a list of integers that serves as the random seed for generating noise. If a list is provided, each batch item will use its own Brownian tree with a unique seed.
· transform: A callable function that maps the sigma values to the internal timestep used by the sampler.
· tree: An instance of BatchedBrownianTree that manages the Brownian tree process for generating noise samples.

**Code Description**: The BrownianTreeNoiseSampler class is designed to facilitate the generation of noise samples based on a Brownian tree process, which is a mathematical model used in stochastic calculus. The constructor of the class initializes the noise sampler by taking in several parameters, including a tensor `x` that determines the characteristics of the generated noise, the minimum and maximum sigma values that define the range of noise, a seed for randomness, and a transformation function that maps sigma values to the internal time steps used in the Brownian tree.

Upon initialization, the class computes the transformed values of `sigma_min` and `sigma_max` and creates a BatchedBrownianTree instance, which is responsible for the actual noise generation. The `__call__` method allows the instance to be invoked directly, taking in two sigma values (`sigma` and `sigma_next`) and returning the generated noise based on the Brownian tree process. The noise is scaled by the square root of the absolute difference between the two transformed sigma values.

The BrownianTreeNoiseSampler is utilized in various sampling functions, such as `sample_dpmpp_sde`, `sample_dpmpp_2m_sde`, and `sample_dpmpp_3m_sde`, where it provides the necessary noise samples during the sampling process. These functions leverage the noise sampler to introduce stochasticity into the model's predictions, thereby enhancing the robustness and diversity of the generated outputs.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the tensor `x` is appropriately shaped and located on the correct device (CPU or GPU) to avoid runtime errors. Additionally, the choice of the seed can significantly impact the reproducibility of the results, especially when using a list of seeds for batch processing.

**Output Example**: A possible output from the BrownianTreeNoiseSampler when called with specific sigma values might look like a tensor of random values, such as:
```
tensor([[0.1234, -0.5678, 0.9101],
        [-0.2345, 0.6789, -0.1234]])
```
### FunctionDef __init__(self, x, sigma_min, sigma_max, seed, transform, cpu)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize an instance of the BrownianTreeNoiseSampler class, setting up the necessary parameters for generating Brownian motion paths.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· x: The initial state or input tensor for the Brownian tree process.  
· sigma_min: The minimum value of the noise scale, which will be transformed for the Brownian motion.  
· sigma_max: The maximum value of the noise scale, which will also be transformed for the Brownian motion.  
· seed: An optional parameter that specifies the random seed or seeds used for generating the Brownian motion. If not provided, a random seed will be generated.  
· transform: A function that applies a transformation to the sigma_min and sigma_max values before they are used in the Brownian tree process. By default, it is set to the identity function (lambda x: x).  
· cpu: A boolean flag indicating whether the Brownian trees should be created on the CPU. The default value is False.

**Code Description**: The __init__ function serves as the constructor for the BrownianTreeNoiseSampler class. It initializes the instance by accepting several parameters that dictate the behavior of the Brownian motion generation. The function first assigns the provided transformation function to the instance variable `self.transform`. It then applies this transformation to both sigma_min and sigma_max, converting them into tensor format using `torch.as_tensor`. The transformed values, t0 and t1, represent the time parameters for the Brownian motion.

Subsequently, the constructor creates an instance of the BatchedBrownianTree class, passing the initial state tensor `x`, the transformed time parameters `t0` and `t1`, along with the optional seed and cpu flag. The BatchedBrownianTree class is designed to handle batches of entropy and generate multiple Brownian motion paths efficiently. It sorts the time parameters and manages the creation of Brownian trees based on the provided seeds, ensuring that the process can accommodate both batched and non-batched inputs.

The relationship between the BrownianTreeNoiseSampler and the BatchedBrownianTree is integral, as the former relies on the latter to facilitate the generation of noise samples necessary for diffusion processes. The initialization of the BatchedBrownianTree within the __init__ function establishes the foundation for subsequent operations that involve generating and manipulating Brownian motion paths.

**Note**: When using the BrownianTreeNoiseSampler, it is essential to ensure that the input tensor `x` and the time parameters `sigma_min` and `sigma_max` are appropriately defined. The `seed` parameter can be a single integer or a list of integers, depending on whether batched inputs are being utilized. The transformation function should also be chosen carefully to ensure it aligns with the intended noise characteristics.

### FunctionDef __call__(self, sigma, sigma_next)
**__call__**: The function of __call__ is to compute a normalized tree noise value based on two input sigma values.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· sigma: A float or tensor representing the current noise level in the sampling process.  
· sigma_next: A float or tensor representing the next noise level in the sampling process.

**Code Description**: The __call__ function takes two parameters, sigma and sigma_next, which are expected to be either floats or tensors. It first transforms these parameters using the `transform` method, which converts them into tensors. The transformed values are stored in t0 and t1. The function then computes the tree noise by calling the `tree` method with t0 and t1 as arguments. The result of this computation is then normalized by dividing it by the square root of the absolute difference between t1 and t0. This normalization ensures that the output is scaled appropriately based on the difference in noise levels, which is crucial for maintaining stability in the sampling process.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the inputs sigma and sigma_next are valid and compatible with the `transform` method and the `tree` method. The function assumes that the difference between t1 and t0 is non-zero to avoid division by zero errors.

**Output Example**: An example return value of the function could be a tensor representing the normalized tree noise, such as `tensor([0.5])`, indicating the computed noise level based on the provided sigma values.

## FunctionDef sample_euler(model, x, sigmas, extra_args, callback, disable, s_churn, s_tmin, s_tmax, s_noise)
**sample_euler**: The function of sample_euler is to implement the Euler steps for sampling as described in Algorithm 2 of Karras et al. (2022).

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· parameter1: model - A callable model that performs denoising on the input tensor based on the specified noise level.  
· parameter2: x - A tensor representing the initial state or input to the denoising model.  
· parameter3: sigmas - A tensor containing the noise levels at each step of the sampling process.  
· parameter4: extra_args - Optional additional arguments to be passed to the model during denoising. Defaults to None.  
· parameter5: callback - An optional function that is called at each step of the sampling process, allowing for custom actions or logging. Defaults to None.  
· parameter6: disable - A boolean flag to disable progress tracking during the sampling process. Defaults to None.  
· parameter7: s_churn - A float that controls the degree of noise added during the sampling process. Defaults to 0.0.  
· parameter8: s_tmin - A float representing the minimum noise level for which to apply the churn. Defaults to 0.0.  
· parameter9: s_tmax - A float representing the maximum noise level for which to apply the churn. Defaults to infinity.  
· parameter10: s_noise - A float representing the standard deviation of the noise added to the input tensor. Defaults to 1.0.

**Code Description**: The sample_euler function executes the Euler sampling method, which is a numerical technique used to approximate solutions to ordinary differential equations (ODEs). The function begins by initializing the extra_args to an empty dictionary if it is not provided. It then creates a tensor s_in filled with ones, which matches the batch size of the input tensor x.

The function iterates over the range of noise levels specified in the sigmas tensor, excluding the last element. For each noise level, it calculates a gamma value that determines the amount of noise to be added based on the current sigma value and the specified churn parameters. If the current sigma is within the defined range (between s_tmin and s_tmax), the function computes a modified noise level sigma_hat.

If gamma is greater than zero, the function generates random noise and adds it to the input tensor x, scaled by the difference between sigma_hat and the current sigma. The model is then called with the modified input tensor and noise level to produce a denoised output. The to_d function is subsequently invoked to compute the Karras ODE derivative, which is essential for updating the state of the tensor x.

If a callback function is provided, it is executed at each step with the current state of x, the iteration index, and the relevant sigma values. The Euler method is applied by updating the tensor x based on the computed derivative and the difference between the current and next sigma values.

The function concludes by returning the final state of the tensor x after all iterations are complete. The sample_euler function is integral to the sampling process in diffusion models, as it systematically refines the input tensor through a series of denoising steps.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the model provided is compatible with the input tensor x and the noise levels in sigmas. Users should also be aware of the potential impact of the s_churn, s_tmin, s_tmax, and s_noise parameters on the sampling process, as they can significantly influence the quality of the generated samples.

**Output Example**: For an input tensor x with shape (4, 3, 64, 64) and a sigmas tensor of shape (10,), the output of sample_euler would be a tensor with the same shape as x, representing the refined state after applying the Euler sampling method across the specified noise levels.
## FunctionDef sample_euler_ancestral(model, x, sigmas, extra_args, callback, disable, eta, s_noise, noise_sampler)
**sample_euler_ancestral**: The function of sample_euler_ancestral is to perform ancestral sampling using Euler method steps.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· parameter1: model - A callable model that takes input tensor x and noise level to produce a denoised output.  
· parameter2: x - A tensor representing the initial state or input to the denoising model.  
· parameter3: sigmas - A tensor containing the noise levels at each step of the sampling process.

· parameter8: s_noise - A float (default is 1.0) that scales the noise added during the sampling process.  
· parameter9: noise_sampler - An optional function for generating noise; if not provided, a default noise sampler is used.

**Code Description**: The sample_euler_ancestral function implements a sampling strategy based on the Euler method, which is a numerical technique for solving ordinary differential equations. This function takes a model, an initial input tensor x, and a series of noise levels (sigmas) to iteratively denoise the input and generate a new sample.

The function begins by initializing any optional parameters, such as extra_args and noise_sampler. If no noise_sampler is provided, it defaults to a function that generates noise matching the shape of x. The function then creates a tensor s_in filled with ones, which will be used to scale the noise levels.

The main loop iterates over the range of noise levels (sigmas), excluding the last one. For each noise level, the model is called to produce a denoised output based on the current input x and the corresponding noise level. The function get_ancestral_step is invoked to calculate the next noise levels (sigma_down and sigma_up) based on the current and next noise levels, as well as the eta parameter.

If a callback function is provided, it is called with the current state of x, the iteration index, and the current noise level. The function then computes the derivative using the to_d function, which converts the denoised output into a Karras ODE derivative. The Euler method is applied to update the input tensor x based on the computed derivative and the time step (dt) derived from the noise levels.

Finally, if the next noise level is greater than zero, additional noise is added to the updated tensor x, scaled by the noise sampler and the s_noise parameter. The function returns the final sampled tensor x after completing all iterations.

The sample_euler_ancestral function is closely related to other sampling functions in the module, such as sample_euler and sample_heun, which also utilize the to_d and get_ancestral_step functions to perform their respective sampling strategies. This highlights the modular design of the sampling methods, allowing for flexibility and reusability of the underlying components.

**Note**: Users should ensure that the input tensor x and the noise levels in sigmas are appropriately initialized and compatible in terms of dimensions. The eta parameter directly influences the amount of noise added during the sampling process, and its value should be chosen carefully to achieve the desired sampling behavior.

**Output Example**: An example output of the function could be a tensor representing the sampled state after processing through the model and applying the Euler method, such as:
```python
tensor([[0.5, 0.2], [0.3, 0.8]])
```
## FunctionDef sample_heun(model, x, sigmas, extra_args, callback, disable, s_churn, s_tmin, s_tmax, s_noise)
**sample_heun**: The function of sample_heun is to implement the Heun steps algorithm for sampling in the context of denoising diffusion models, as described in Karras et al. (2022).

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· parameter1: model - A callable model that takes an input tensor and a noise level to produce a denoised output.  
· parameter2: x - A tensor representing the initial state or input to the denoising model.  
· parameter3: sigmas - A tensor containing the noise levels at each step of the sampling process.  
· parameter4: extra_args - A dictionary of additional arguments to be passed to the model (default is None).  
· parameter5: callback - An optional function that is called at each step with the current state and parameters (default is None).  
· parameter6: disable - A boolean flag to disable the progress bar (default is None).  
· parameter7: s_churn - A float that controls the amount of noise added to the input tensor during sampling (default is 0.0).  
· parameter8: s_tmin - A float representing the minimum noise level for which to apply the churn (default is 0.0).  
· parameter9: s_tmax - A float representing the maximum noise level for which to apply the churn (default is infinity).  
· parameter10: s_noise - A float representing the standard deviation of the noise added to the input tensor (default is 1.0).

**Code Description**: The sample_heun function executes the Heun method for sampling in a denoising diffusion process. It begins by initializing the extra_args to an empty dictionary if not provided and creates a tensor s_in filled with ones, matching the batch size of the input tensor x. The function then iterates over the range of noise levels defined in the sigmas tensor, excluding the last element. 

During each iteration, it calculates a gamma value based on the current noise level and the specified churn parameters. If the gamma value is greater than zero, it adds Gaussian noise to the input tensor x, scaled by the current noise level. The model is then called to produce a denoised output based on the modified input tensor and the adjusted noise level (sigma_hat). 

The function subsequently computes the Karras ODE derivative using the to_d function, which normalizes the difference between the input tensor and the denoised output. If a callback function is provided, it is invoked with the current state and parameters. The function then determines the time step (dt) based on the difference between the current and next noise levels. 

If the next noise level is zero, the function applies the Euler method for updating the state of x. Otherwise, it employs Heun's method, which involves an additional prediction step to refine the update of x. The final output of the function is the updated tensor x after processing through all the noise levels.

The sample_heun function relies on the to_d function to compute the necessary derivatives for updating the state of the input tensor. This relationship is crucial as it ensures that the sampling process adheres to the mathematical framework established by the Karras ODE, facilitating effective denoising through structured updates.

**Note**: Users should ensure that the input tensor x and the sigmas tensor are compatible in terms of dimensions to avoid runtime errors. Additionally, the behavior of the function is influenced by the parameters s_churn, s_tmin, s_tmax, and s_noise, which should be set according to the specific requirements of the sampling process.

**Output Example**: For an input tensor x with shape (3, 4) and a sigmas tensor of shape (5,), the output of sample_heun would be a tensor with shape (3, 4) representing the final denoised state after processing through the specified noise levels.
## FunctionDef sample_dpm_2(model, x, sigmas, extra_args, callback, disable, s_churn, s_tmin, s_tmax, s_noise)
**sample_dpm_2**: The function of sample_dpm_2 is to perform sampling based on the DPM-Solver-2 algorithm, facilitating the denoising process in a structured manner.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· parameter1: model - A callable model that takes an input tensor and a noise level to produce a denoised output.  
· parameter2: x - A tensor representing the initial state or input to the denoising model.  
· parameter3: sigmas - A tensor containing the noise levels at which the sampling will be performed.  
· parameter4: extra_args - Optional additional arguments to be passed to the model during denoising.  
· parameter5: callback - An optional function that can be called at each iteration to provide intermediate results.  
· parameter6: disable - A boolean flag to disable the progress bar during sampling.  
· parameter7: s_churn - A float representing the amount of noise to add during the sampling process.  
· parameter8: s_tmin - A float indicating the minimum sigma value for the sampling process.  
· parameter9: s_tmax - A float indicating the maximum sigma value for the sampling process.  
· parameter10: s_noise - A float representing the standard deviation of the noise added to the input tensor.

**Code Description**: The sample_dpm_2 function implements a sampling algorithm inspired by DPM-Solver-2 and Algorithm 2 from Karras et al. (2022). The function begins by initializing the extra_args to an empty dictionary if it is not provided. It also creates a tensor s_in filled with ones, which matches the batch size of the input tensor x. The main loop iterates over the range of the sigmas tensor, excluding the last element, to perform the sampling process.

Within the loop, the function calculates a variable gamma based on the s_churn parameter and the current sigma value. If the current sigma is within the specified bounds (s_tmin and s_tmax), gamma is computed; otherwise, it is set to zero. The sigma_hat variable is then calculated, which adjusts the current sigma based on gamma.

If gamma is greater than zero, noise is added to the input tensor x, scaled by the difference between sigma_hat squared and the current sigma squared. The model is then called with the modified input tensor and the adjusted sigma_hat, producing a denoised output. The to_d function is subsequently called to compute the Karras ODE derivative based on the current state, sigma_hat, and the denoised output.

The function checks if a callback is provided and, if so, invokes it with the current state and parameters. Depending on whether the next sigma value is zero or not, the function either applies the Euler method or the DPM-Solver-2 method to update the state of x. The process continues until all sigma values have been processed, and the final denoised tensor is returned.

The to_d function, which is called within sample_dpm_2, plays a crucial role in converting the denoised output into a Karras ODE derivative, ensuring that the sampling process is mathematically sound and consistent with the Karras framework.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the input tensor x and the sigma tensor are compatible in terms of dimensions. Users should also be aware that the behavior of the function relies on the proper functioning of the model and the callback, particularly when handling tensors with varying dimensions.

**Output Example**: For an input tensor x with shape (3, 4) and a sigmas tensor of shape (10,), the output of sample_dpm_2 would be a tensor with shape (3, 4) representing the final denoised state after processing through the sampling algorithm.
## FunctionDef sample_dpm_2_ancestral(model, x, sigmas, extra_args, callback, disable, eta, s_noise, noise_sampler)
**sample_dpm_2_ancestral**: The function of sample_dpm_2_ancestral is to perform ancestral sampling using DPM-Solver second-order steps.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· parameter1: model - A callable model that takes an input tensor and a noise level to produce a denoised output.  
· parameter2: x - A tensor representing the initial input state for the sampling process.  
· parameter3: sigmas - A list or tensor of noise levels that guide the sampling steps.  
· parameter4: extra_args - Optional additional arguments to be passed to the model during sampling (default is None).  
· parameter5: callback - An optional function that is called at each sampling step with the current state and parameters (default is None).  
· parameter6: disable - A boolean flag to disable progress tracking (default is None).  
· parameter7: eta - A float that controls the amount of noise added during the sampling process (default is 1.0).  
· parameter8: s_noise - A float representing the scaling factor for the noise added during the sampling (default is 1.0).  
· parameter9: noise_sampler - An optional function to sample noise; if not provided, a default noise sampler is used (default is None).

**Code Description**: The sample_dpm_2_ancestral function implements a sampling algorithm based on the DPM-Solver framework, specifically utilizing second-order steps for improved sampling quality. The function begins by initializing the extra_args to an empty dictionary if not provided and sets up a noise sampler using the default_noise_sampler function if none is specified. It also initializes a tensor s_in filled with ones, which is used to scale the denoised output based on the input tensor x.

The function then enters a loop that iterates over the provided noise levels in sigmas, excluding the last element. For each noise level, it computes the denoised output by calling the model with the current input tensor x and the corresponding noise level scaled by s_in. The get_ancestral_step function is then invoked to calculate the next noise levels, sigma_down and sigma_up, which dictate how the sampling progresses.

If a callback function is provided, it is called with the current state of x, the iteration index, and the current noise level. The function then computes the derivative d using the to_d function, which converts the denoised output into a Karras ODE derivative. Depending on the value of sigma_down, the function applies either the Euler method or the DPM-Solver-2 method to update the state of x. In the case of the DPM-Solver-2 method, an additional denoised output is computed to refine the state update.

Finally, the function adds noise sampled from the noise_sampler to the updated state of x, scaled by s_noise and sigma_up. The process continues until all noise levels have been processed, and the final state of x is returned.

This function is closely related to several other functions within the module, including to_d, get_ancestral_step, and default_noise_sampler. Each of these functions plays a crucial role in the sampling process, with to_d providing the necessary derivative calculations, get_ancestral_step determining the noise levels for each step, and default_noise_sampler generating the required noise.

**Note**: Users should ensure that the input tensor x and the noise levels in sigmas are appropriately set up before calling this function. Additionally, the behavior of the function is influenced by the choice of the eta parameter, which controls the amount of noise added during the sampling process. Proper initialization of the model and any additional arguments is also essential for the function to operate correctly.

**Output Example**: An example output of the function could be a tensor representing the final state after sampling, such as:
```python
output_tensor = sample_dpm_2_ancestral(model, initial_tensor, noise_levels)
# output_tensor would be a tensor of the same shape as the input tensor, representing the sampled output.
```
## FunctionDef linear_multistep_coeff(order, t, i, j)
**linear_multistep_coeff**: The function of linear_multistep_coeff is to compute the coefficients for a linear multistep method based on the specified order and time steps.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· order: An integer representing the order of the multistep method. It determines how many previous steps are considered in the calculation of the coefficients.
· t: A sequence of time steps (typically an array or list) at which the coefficients are evaluated.
· i: An integer index representing the current step in the time sequence.
· j: An integer index used to compute the specific coefficient for the j-th previous step.

**Code Description**: The linear_multistep_coeff function begins by validating the input parameters. It checks if the order minus one exceeds the index i, raising a ValueError if this condition is met. This ensures that the function does not attempt to access out-of-bounds elements in the time steps array.

The function defines an inner function, fn(tau), which calculates the product of terms necessary for determining the coefficient. This product iterates over the range of the order, skipping the j-th index. For each k in the range, it computes the ratio of the difference between tau and the time step at index (i - k) to the difference between the time steps at indices (i - j) and (i - k). This ratio is crucial for the multistep method as it helps in weighting the contributions of previous steps.

Finally, the function uses the integrate.quad method from the SciPy library to numerically integrate the fn function over the interval defined by the time steps t[i] and t[i + 1]. The integration result, which represents the computed coefficient, is returned.

This function is called within the sample_lms function, which is responsible for sampling from a model using a linear multistep method. In sample_lms, the linear_multistep_coeff function is invoked to calculate the coefficients for the current order based on the current step index and the provided sigmas. These coefficients are then used to update the variable x by combining the denoised outputs from previous steps, effectively implementing a multistep denoising process.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the order parameter is appropriate for the number of steps being processed to avoid ValueErrors. Users should also be aware of the numerical integration's tolerance settings, as these can affect the accuracy of the computed coefficients.

**Output Example**: A possible return value of the linear_multistep_coeff function could be a floating-point number representing the computed coefficient, such as 0.123456789.
### FunctionDef fn(tau)
**fn**: The function of fn is to compute a product based on the given input parameter tau and the indices defined by the variables order, j, i, and t.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· tau: A numerical value representing the input for which the product is calculated.

**Code Description**: The function fn calculates a product based on the input parameter tau. It initializes a variable `prod` to 1.0, which will hold the cumulative product result. The function then iterates over a range defined by the variable `order`. For each index `k` in this range, it checks if `j` is equal to `k`. If they are equal, the iteration continues to the next index without executing the subsequent lines for that iteration. If they are not equal, the function computes a fraction where the numerator is the difference between tau and the value at index `i - k` from the list `t`, and the denominator is the difference between the value at index `i - j` and the value at index `i - k` from the list `t`. This fraction is then multiplied with the current value of `prod`, effectively accumulating the product of all valid fractions computed during the iterations. Finally, the function returns the computed product.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the variables `order`, `j`, `i`, and `t` are defined and initialized appropriately in the surrounding context where this function is called. The function assumes that `t` is a list or array-like structure that contains numerical values.

**Output Example**: If tau is 5, order is 3, j is 1, i is 2, and t is [1, 3, 5, 7], the function might return a value like 0.5, depending on the specific calculations performed within the loop.
***
## FunctionDef sample_lms(model, x, sigmas, extra_args, callback, disable, order)
**sample_lms**: The function of sample_lms is to perform sampling from a model using a linear multistep method for denoising.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· parameter1: model - The denoising model used to generate denoised outputs based on the input tensor and noise levels.  
· parameter2: x - A tensor representing the current state or input to the denoising model.  
· parameter3: sigmas - A tensor representing the noise levels at each sampling step.  
· parameter4: extra_args - A dictionary of additional arguments to be passed to the model (default is None).  
· parameter5: callback - An optional function that can be called at each step with the current state and other relevant information (default is None).  
· parameter6: disable - A boolean flag to disable progress tracking (default is None).  
· parameter7: order - An integer representing the order of the multistep method (default is 4).

**Code Description**: The sample_lms function implements a linear multistep sampling method to iteratively denoise an input tensor x based on varying noise levels specified in the sigmas tensor. The function begins by initializing an array of ones, s_in, which is used to scale the input tensor during the denoising process. The sigmas tensor is detached from the computation graph and converted to a NumPy array for further processing.

The function then enters a loop that iterates over the range of the sigmas tensor, excluding the last element. In each iteration, the model is called with the current input tensor x and the corresponding noise level from sigmas, scaled by s_in. The output from the model, referred to as denoised, is then processed using the to_d function, which converts the denoised output into a Karras ODE derivative. This derivative is appended to a list ds, which stores the derivatives for the previous steps.

If the length of ds exceeds the specified order, the oldest derivative is removed to maintain the correct number of previous steps. If a callback function is provided, it is invoked with the current state, including the input tensor, iteration index, current sigma, and the denoised output.

The function then calculates the current order of coefficients to be used for updating the input tensor x. These coefficients are computed using the linear_multistep_coeff function, which determines the appropriate weights based on the current step index and the provided sigmas. The input tensor x is then updated by adding a weighted sum of the derivatives stored in ds, effectively applying the multistep denoising process.

Finally, the function returns the updated tensor x, which represents the denoised output after processing through the specified number of steps.

The sample_lms function relies on the to_d function to compute the Karras ODE derivative and the linear_multistep_coeff function to calculate the coefficients for the multistep method. These relationships are crucial for the overall functionality of the sampling process, as they ensure that the denoising is performed in a structured and mathematically sound manner.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the input tensor x and the sigmas tensor are compatible in terms of dimensions. Users should also be aware that the order parameter should be set appropriately to match the number of steps being processed to avoid runtime errors. The callback function, if used, should be designed to handle the data structure passed to it at each step.

**Output Example**: For an input tensor x with shape (3, 4) and a corresponding sigmas tensor of shape (5,), the output of sample_lms could be a tensor with shape (3, 4) representing the denoised version of the input tensor after processing through the specified sampling steps.
## ClassDef PIDStepSizeController
**PIDStepSizeController**: The function of PIDStepSizeController is to manage adaptive step size control in ordinary differential equation (ODE) solvers using a Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) control strategy.

**attributes**: The attributes of this Class.
· h: The current step size for the ODE solver.
· b1: The proportional coefficient adjusted based on the PID parameters and order.
· b2: The integral coefficient adjusted based on the PID parameters and order.
· b3: The derivative coefficient adjusted based on the PID parameters and order.
· accept_safety: A threshold factor to determine if the proposed step size is acceptable.
· eps: A small value to prevent division by zero in calculations.
· errs: A list to store the last three error values for the PID controller.

**Code Description**: The PIDStepSizeController class implements a PID controller specifically designed for adaptive step size control in numerical methods for solving ordinary differential equations (ODEs). The constructor initializes the step size (h) and PID coefficients (pcoeff, icoeff, dcoeff) along with other parameters such as accept_safety and eps. The coefficients are used to compute the control factors that influence the step size based on the errors encountered during the ODE solving process.

The class includes a method `limiter` that applies a limiting function to ensure the step size adjustment remains within reasonable bounds. The `propose_step` method calculates a new step size based on the most recent error, adjusting the step size according to the PID control logic. It uses the stored errors to compute a factor that modifies the current step size, and checks if the proposed step size meets the acceptance criteria defined by accept_safety. If the proposed step size is accepted, it updates the error history and modifies the current step size accordingly.

This class is utilized within the `dpm_solver_adaptive` method of the DPMSolver class. In this context, PIDStepSizeController plays a critical role in dynamically adjusting the step size during the adaptive sampling process. The method continuously evaluates the error between low-order and high-order solutions, using the PID controller to propose a new step size that maintains the desired accuracy while optimizing computational efficiency. The interaction between PIDStepSizeController and dpm_solver_adaptive ensures that the numerical solver can adaptively manage its step size based on real-time error feedback, enhancing the overall performance of the ODE solver.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the parameters passed to the PIDStepSizeController are appropriately set to avoid instability in step size adjustments. The accept_safety parameter should be chosen carefully to balance between step size acceptance and computational efficiency.

**Output Example**: A possible return value from the `propose_step` method could be a boolean indicating whether the proposed step size was accepted, along with the updated step size value. For instance, if the error was within acceptable limits, the output might be:
```
accept = True
new_step_size = 0.04
```
### FunctionDef __init__(self, h, pcoeff, icoeff, dcoeff, order, accept_safety, eps)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize an instance of the PIDStepSizeController class with specified parameters.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· h: A numerical value representing the step size or time increment for the controller.  
· pcoeff: A numerical coefficient for the proportional term in the PID controller.  
· icoeff: A numerical coefficient for the integral term in the PID controller.  
· dcoeff: A numerical coefficient for the derivative term in the PID controller.  
· order: An optional integer that specifies the order of the controller, defaulting to 1.  
· accept_safety: A float value that sets the safety margin for acceptance, defaulting to 0.81.  
· eps: A small float value used to prevent division by zero, defaulting to 1e-8.  

**Code Description**: The __init__ function is the constructor for the PIDStepSizeController class. It initializes the instance with several key parameters that define the behavior of the PID controller. The parameter 'h' sets the step size for the controller, which is crucial for determining how the controller reacts over time. The coefficients pcoeff, icoeff, and dcoeff are used to calculate the PID controller's gains, which are essential for controlling the system's response. 

The constructor computes three internal variables: 
- 'b1' is calculated as the average of the three coefficients (pcoeff, icoeff, and dcoeff) divided by the order. This represents the overall proportional gain of the controller.
- 'b2' is computed as the negative sum of the proportional coefficient and twice the derivative coefficient, divided by the order. This term influences the controller's response to changes in the error signal.
- 'b3' is simply the derivative coefficient divided by the order, which affects the rate of change of the control output.

The 'accept_safety' parameter is used to define a threshold for accepting control actions, ensuring that the controller operates within safe limits. The 'eps' parameter is a small constant added to prevent numerical issues such as division by zero. Finally, 'errs' is initialized as an empty list, which can be used to store error values during the operation of the controller.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the coefficients provided are appropriate for the specific control application to achieve desired performance. The order parameter should also be set correctly to match the intended control strategy.

### FunctionDef limiter(self, x)
**limiter**: The function of limiter is to constrain the input value using a mathematical transformation.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· x: A float value that represents the input to be limited.

**Code Description**: The limiter function takes a single parameter, x, and applies the mathematical function `1 + math.atan(x - 1)` to it. The purpose of this transformation is to ensure that the output remains within a certain range, effectively limiting the influence of extreme values of x. The `math.atan` function computes the arctangent of the input, which asymptotically approaches π/2 as x increases, thus providing a natural cap on the output value. This function is called within the propose_step method of the PIDStepSizeController class, where it is used to adjust a factor derived from the inverse of an error value. The factor is calculated based on the current and previous error values raised to specific powers (b1, b2, b3). By applying the limiter to this factor, the code ensures that the step size adjustment remains within acceptable bounds, enhancing the stability of the PID controller's response to errors. If the resulting factor after applying the limiter is greater than or equal to a predefined safety threshold (accept_safety), the step is accepted, and the error history is updated accordingly.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the input to the limiter function is a valid float value, as the behavior of the function relies on the mathematical properties of the arctangent function.

**Output Example**: For an input value of x = 3, the return value of the limiter function would be approximately 2.5, calculated as `1 + math.atan(3 - 1)`.
***
### FunctionDef propose_step(self, error)
**propose_step**: The function of propose_step is to determine whether to accept a proposed step size based on the calculated error.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· error: A float value representing the calculated error from the previous step, which is used to adjust the step size.

**Code Description**: The propose_step function is a critical component of the PIDStepSizeController class, which is designed to manage the step size in numerical methods for solving differential equations. The function begins by calculating the inverse of the error, adding a small epsilon value (self.eps) to prevent division by zero. If this is the first call to propose_step (indicated by an empty error history), it initializes the error history (self.errs) with three identical values of the inverse error.

The function then updates the first entry of the error history with the newly calculated inverse error. A factor is computed based on the current and previous error values, raised to the powers defined by the coefficients b1, b2, and b3. This factor is subsequently passed through a limiter function to constrain its value within a specified range, ensuring stability in the step size adjustment.

The function checks if the resulting factor meets or exceeds a predefined safety threshold (self.accept_safety). If the factor is acceptable, it updates the error history by shifting the previous errors, effectively maintaining a record of the last three errors for future calculations. The step size (self.h) is then adjusted by multiplying it with the computed factor.

The function concludes by returning a boolean value indicating whether the proposed step size was accepted based on the calculated factor.

The propose_step function is called within the dpm_solver_adaptive method of the DPMSolver class. This method implements an adaptive solver for differential equations, where it repeatedly calls propose_step to determine if the current step size should be accepted based on the error calculated from the denoised outputs of the previous steps. The integration of propose_step within dpm_solver_adaptive ensures that the step size is dynamically adjusted, enhancing the solver's efficiency and accuracy.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the error parameter passed to propose_step is a valid float value, as the function relies on accurate error calculations to determine the step size adjustment.

**Output Example**: For an input error value of 0.02, if the computed factor after applying the limiter is 1.1 and meets the accept_safety threshold, the function would return True, indicating that the proposed step size is accepted.

**DPMSolver**: The function of DPMSolver is to implement the DPM-Solver algorithm for denoising diffusion processes.

**attributes**: The attributes of this Class.
· model: The neural network model used for generating predictions during the denoising process.
· extra_args: A dictionary for any additional arguments that may be required by the model.
· eps_callback: A callback function that is called after each epsilon computation, useful for tracking progress.
· info_callback: A callback function that is called to provide information during the sampling process.

**Code Description**: The DPMSolver class is designed to facilitate the Denoising Probabilistic Model (DPM) Solver, which is a method for sampling from a diffusion model. The class inherits from `nn.Module`, indicating that it is a PyTorch module, and it is initialized with a model, optional extra arguments, and two callback functions for tracking progress and information.

The class provides several methods for computing the necessary transformations and updates during the sampling process:

- The `t` method computes the negative logarithm of the input sigma value, which is used to derive time steps in the diffusion process.
- The `sigma` method computes the exponential of the negative input time, providing the corresponding noise level at that time.
- The `eps` method calculates the epsilon value, which represents the noise to be removed from the input. It checks if the value is already cached to avoid redundant computations.
- The `dpm_solver_1_step`, `dpm_solver_2_step`, and `dpm_solver_3_step` methods implement different orders of the DPM solver, allowing for varying levels of accuracy and computational efficiency during the denoising process.
- The `dpm_solver_fast` method executes the DPM solver with a fixed step size, iterating through a specified number of steps while applying the model to denoise the input.
- The `dpm_solver_adaptive` method allows for adaptive step sizes based on error estimates, providing a more flexible approach to sampling.

The DPMSolver class is called by the functions `sample_dpm_fast` and `sample_dpm_adaptive`, which serve as higher-level interfaces for users to perform sampling using the DPM solver. These functions create an instance of DPMSolver, passing the model and any additional parameters, and then invoke the appropriate solver method to generate denoised outputs. The callbacks provided in these functions allow for real-time updates during the sampling process, enhancing user experience and monitoring.

**Note**: When using the DPMSolver, ensure that the model provided is compatible with the expected input dimensions and that any additional arguments required by the model are correctly specified. The epsilon callback can be utilized to monitor the progress of the denoising process, while the info callback can provide insights into the current state of the sampling.

**Output Example**: A possible output of the DPMSolver after processing might be a tensor representing the denoised image or signal, which could look like a multi-dimensional array of pixel values or signal amplitudes, depending on the application context.
### FunctionDef __init__(self, model, extra_args, eps_callback, info_callback)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize an instance of the DPMSolver class with a model and optional parameters.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· model: The model that the DPMSolver will utilize for its operations. This is a required parameter.
· extra_args: A dictionary of additional arguments that can be passed to the DPMSolver. If not provided, it defaults to an empty dictionary.
· eps_callback: An optional callback function that can be used to process or modify epsilon values during the operation of the DPMSolver.
· info_callback: An optional callback function that can be used to provide additional information or logging during the operation of the DPMSolver.

**Code Description**: The __init__ function is the constructor for the DPMSolver class. It begins by calling the constructor of its superclass using `super().__init__()`, which ensures that any initialization defined in the parent class is executed. The function then assigns the provided model to the instance variable `self.model`, which will be used throughout the class for various computations. The `extra_args` parameter is checked; if it is not provided (i.e., it is None), it is initialized to an empty dictionary to ensure that the class has a valid structure for additional arguments. The `eps_callback` and `info_callback` parameters are stored as instance variables, allowing the class to utilize these callback functions during its operations if they are provided.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the model passed to this function is compatible with the DPMSolver's expected input. Additionally, if using the optional callback functions, they should be defined to handle the expected input and output types to avoid runtime errors.
***
### FunctionDef t(self, sigma)
**t**: The function of t is to compute the negative logarithm of the input parameter sigma.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· sigma: A tensor representing the standard deviation in the diffusion process.

**Code Description**: The function `t` takes a single parameter, `sigma`, which is expected to be a tensor. It computes the negative logarithm of `sigma` using the `log()` method, and returns the result. This function is crucial in the context of diffusion models, particularly in the DPMSolver class, as it transforms the standard deviation into a logarithmic scale, which is often more suitable for numerical stability and optimization in machine learning tasks.

The `t` function is called within the methods `dpm_solver_fast` and `dpm_solver_adaptive`. In `dpm_solver_fast`, it is used to calculate `t_next_` when the `eta` parameter is set, which is part of the ancestral sampling step. Similarly, in `dpm_solver_adaptive`, it is utilized to determine the next time step in the adaptive sampling process. The logarithmic transformation provided by `t` helps in managing the scale of the values involved in these computations, ensuring that the algorithms can effectively handle the variations in `sigma`.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the input `sigma` is greater than zero before calling this function, as the logarithm of zero or a negative number is undefined and will result in an error.

**Output Example**: If `sigma` is a tensor with a value of 0.1, the output of the function `t` would be approximately 2.3026, which is the negative logarithm of 0.1.
***
### FunctionDef sigma(self, t)
**sigma**: The function of sigma is to compute the exponential of the negative input value.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· t: A tensor representing the input value for which the sigma function will compute the exponential of its negative.

**Code Description**: The sigma function takes a single parameter, t, which is expected to be a tensor. It computes the negative of t using the `neg()` method and then applies the `exp()` method to calculate the exponential of the negated value. This operation is mathematically represented as exp(-t). 

The sigma function is crucial in the context of diffusion models, particularly in the DPMSolver class, where it plays a significant role in the denoising process. It is called by several methods within the DPMSolver class, including `eps`, `dpm_solver_1_step`, `dpm_solver_2_step`, `dpm_solver_3_step`, `dpm_solver_fast`, and `dpm_solver_adaptive`. 

In the `eps` method, sigma is used to scale the input tensor x based on the current time step t, which is essential for calculating the noise estimate. The computed sigma value is multiplied by a tensor of ones to maintain the shape of x. 

In the various dpm_solver methods, sigma is utilized to adjust the denoising steps based on the time intervals between the current and next time steps (t and t_next). The sigma value influences how much the input tensor x is updated during the denoising process, effectively controlling the strength of the denoising operation.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the input tensor t is appropriately defined and that it represents a valid time step within the context of the diffusion process.

**Output Example**: For an input tensor t with a value of 1, the return value of sigma would be approximately 0.3679, as it computes exp(-1).
***

· **kwargs**: Additional keyword arguments that may be passed to the model.

**Code Description**: The eps function is designed to calculate the noise estimate (eps) for a given input tensor (x) at a specific time step (t). It first checks if the noise estimate for the given key is already present in the eps_cache. If it is, the function returns the cached value along with the updated cache. If not, it computes the noise estimate by applying the model to the input tensor (x) scaled by the computed sigma value for the current time step (t). The sigma function is called to obtain the scaling factor, which is essential for the denoising process.

The computed noise estimate is then normalized by dividing the difference between the input tensor and the model output by the sigma value. If an eps_callback is defined, it is invoked to perform any additional operations after the noise estimate is computed. Finally, the function returns the computed noise estimate along with an updated eps_cache that includes the new estimate.

The eps function is called by several methods within the DPMSolver class, including dpm_solver_1_step, dpm_solver_2_step, dpm_solver_3_step, dpm_solver_fast, and dpm_solver_adaptive. Each of these methods utilizes the noise estimate to update the input tensor (x) during the denoising process, effectively controlling the strength of the denoising operation based on the current time step and the computed noise.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the input tensor x and the time step t are appropriately defined and represent valid states within the context of the diffusion process. The eps_cache should be managed carefully to optimize performance and avoid redundant computations.

**Output Example**: For an input tensor x with a value of [1.0, 2.0] and a time step t with a value of 1, the return value of eps could be a tensor representing the estimated noise, such as [0.5, 1.0], along with the updated eps_cache containing the computed noise estimate associated with the provided key.

The function begins by initializing eps_cache to an empty dictionary if it is not provided. It calculates the time interval h as the difference between t_next and t.

Next, the function calls the eps method to compute the noise estimate (eps) for the current input tensor x at time step t, utilizing the eps_cache for efficiency. This noise estimate is crucial for the denoising process, as it provides information about the noise present in the input tensor.

The function then computes the updated tensor x_1 by subtracting a scaled version of the noise estimate from the current input tensor x. The scaling is done using the sigma function, which computes a value based on the current time step t_next. The term h.expm1() is used to account for the time interval in the update.

The updated tensor x_1 and the potentially modified eps_cache are returned as the output of the function.

The dpm_solver_1_step function is called by other methods within the DPMSolver class, specifically dpm_solver_fast and dpm_solver_adaptive. These methods utilize dpm_solver_1_step as part of their denoising process, allowing for iterative updates of the input tensor based on the estimated noise at various time steps. The function plays a critical role in the overall denoising strategy employed by the DPMSolver class.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the input tensor x and the time steps t and t_next are appropriately defined and represent valid states within the context of the diffusion process. The eps_cache should be managed carefully to optimize performance and avoid redundant computations.

**Output Example**: For an input tensor x with a value of [0.5, 0.7] at time step t with a value of 1 and t_next with a value of 1.5, the return value of dpm_solver_1_step could be a tensor representing the updated state, such as [0.4, 0.6], along with the updated eps_cache containing the computed noise estimate associated with the provided key.

· r1: A float value that determines the weighting of the time step in the update process, defaulting to 1/2.
· eps_cache: A dictionary used to cache previously computed noise estimates for efficiency, defaulting to None.

**Code Description**: The dpm_solver_2_step function is designed to update the input tensor x based on the estimated noise at the current time step t and the next time step t_next. The function begins by initializing the eps_cache if it is not provided. It calculates the time interval h between t_next and t, and retrieves the noise estimate (eps) for the current state using the eps method, which also updates the eps_cache.

Next, the function computes a new time step s1, which is a weighted average of the current time t and the next time t_next, using the parameter r1. The input tensor x is then updated to u1 by subtracting a scaled version of the noise estimate eps, where the scaling is determined by the sigma function evaluated at the new time step s1. The sigma function computes the exponential of the negative input value, which is crucial for controlling the strength of the denoising operation.

Following this, the function retrieves another noise estimate (eps_r1) for the updated tensor u1 at the new time step s1. Finally, the function computes the updated tensor x_2 by applying a correction based on the noise estimates eps and eps_r1, scaled by the sigma function evaluated at t_next. The updated tensor x_2 and the updated eps_cache are returned.

The dpm_solver_2_step function is called by other methods within the DPMSolver class, specifically dpm_solver_fast and dpm_solver_adaptive. These methods utilize dpm_solver_2_step as part of their denoising processes, allowing for a more refined update of the input tensor based on the diffusion model's noise estimates.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the input tensor x and the time steps t and t_next are appropriately defined and represent valid states within the context of the diffusion process. The eps_cache should be managed carefully to optimize performance and avoid redundant computations.

**Output Example**: For an input tensor x with a value of [0.5, 1.0], a current time step t with a value of 0.1, and a next time step t_next with a value of 0.2, the return value of dpm_solver_2_step could be an updated tensor such as [0.4, 0.9] along with the updated eps_cache containing the computed noise estimates.

· eps_cache: A dictionary used to cache previously computed noise estimates for efficiency (default is None).

**Code Description**: The dpm_solver_3_step function is designed to update the input tensor x through a series of calculations that involve estimating noise at different time steps. Initially, if eps_cache is not provided, it is initialized as an empty dictionary. The function calculates the time interval h between t and t_next. It then computes the noise estimate eps by calling the eps method, which utilizes the current input tensor x and the current time step t.

The function proceeds to calculate two intermediate time steps, s1 and s2, using the ratios r1 and r2. It updates the input tensor x to u1 by applying the sigma function to s1 and adjusting it based on the noise estimate eps. The eps method is called again to compute eps_r1 for this updated tensor u1 at the time step s1.

Next, the function computes u2, which further refines the input tensor by incorporating the noise estimate eps_r1 and the sigma function applied to s2. The eps method is called once more to compute eps_r2 for u2 at the time step s2.

Finally, the function computes the updated tensor x_3 using the noise estimate eps_r2 and the sigma function applied to t_next. The updated tensor x_3 and the eps_cache are returned.

**Code Description**: The dpm_solver_adaptive function implements an adaptive sampling strategy for diffusion models by dynamically adjusting the step size based on error estimates during the denoising process. The function begins by validating the order parameter, ensuring it is either 2 or 3. It also checks the direction of the sampling process, raising an error if reverse sampling is attempted with a non-zero eta value.

The function initializes several variables, including the initial step size and tolerance values, and sets up a PIDStepSizeController to manage the adaptive step size. The main loop iterates until the current time step reaches the end time, performing the following key operations in each iteration:

1. It computes the next time step based on the current step size.
2. It retrieves the noise estimates using the eps function, which is essential for updating the input tensor.
3. Depending on the specified order, it performs either a two-step or three-step denoising process using the dpm_solver_1_step, dpm_solver_2_step, or dpm_solver_3_step functions.
4. It calculates the error between the low-order and high-order solutions and uses the PID controller to propose a new step size based on this error.
5. If the proposed step size is accepted, the input tensor is updated, and the process continues; otherwise, the step size is adjusted without updating the input tensor.

The function returns the final updated tensor and a dictionary containing information about the number of steps taken, function evaluations, and acceptance/rejection counts. The dpm_solver_adaptive function is called by the sample_dpm_adaptive function, which serves as a higher-level interface for performing adaptive sampling with specified parameters.

**Note**: It is crucial to ensure that the input tensor x and the time steps t_start and t_end are correctly defined and represent valid states within the context of the diffusion process. The order parameter must be set to either 2 or 3, and the noise_sampler should be appropriately configured to ensure effective noise generation during sampling.

# x_updated might be a tensor representing the final state after adaptive sampling.
# info could be a dictionary containing statistics such as:
# {'steps': 10, 'nfe': 30, 'n_accept': 8, 'n_reject': 2}

The dpm_solver_fast method performs the actual denoising process, iterating through the specified number of steps and applying the model to refine the input tensor based on the estimated noise levels.

This function serves as a higher-level interface for users to perform fast sampling using the DPM solver, encapsulating the complexity of the underlying algorithm while providing real-time updates through the callback mechanism.

The sample_dpm_fast function is called by the dpm_fast_function defined in the ksampler module.

**Code Description**: The sample_dpm_adaptive function implements an adaptive sampling strategy for diffusion models by dynamically adjusting the step size based on error estimates during the denoising process. It begins by validating the input parameters, specifically ensuring that sigma_min and sigma_max are greater than zero. A progress bar is created using tqdm, and an instance of the DPMSolver class is initialized with the provided model and any extra arguments. 

The function then checks if a callback function is provided, allowing for real-time updates during the sampling process. The core of the function involves calling the dpm_solver_adaptive method of the DPMSolver instance, which performs the actual adaptive sampling. This method takes the initial input tensor, the transformed time steps derived from sigma_min and sigma_max, and various parameters that control the adaptive sampling behavior.

The output of the function is the denoised tensor, and if return_info is set to True, additional information about the sampling process is also returned. The sample_dpm_adaptive function serves as a higher-level interface for users to perform adaptive sampling, leveraging the capabilities of the DPMSolver class to manage the complexities of the denoising process.

This function is called by the dpm_adaptive_function in the ksampler module, which serves as a wrapper to facilitate the adaptive sampling process by extracting the necessary parameters and invoking sample_dpm_adaptive with the appropriate arguments.

**Note**: It is crucial to ensure that the model provided is compatible with the expected input dimensions and that any additional arguments required by the model are correctly specified. The sigma_min and sigma_max parameters must be greater than zero to avoid errors during the sampling process.

**Output Example**: A possible output of the function could be:
```python

**Code Description**: The sample_dpmpp_2s_ancestral function implements a sampling algorithm based on the DPM-Solver++ (2S) framework, which is designed for generating samples from a probabilistic model. The function begins by initializing the noise sampler and setting up the necessary variables for the sampling process. It defines two lambda functions: one for calculating the sigma function and another for computing the time function.

The main loop iterates over the provided noise levels (sigmas), performing the following steps for each level:
1. The model is called to obtain a denoised output based on the current state and noise level.
2. The function get_ancestral_step is invoked to determine the next noise levels (sigma_down and sigma_up) for the sampling step.
3. If a callback function is provided, it is executed to report the current state and intermediate results.
4. Depending on the value of sigma_down, the function either applies the Euler method or the DPM-Solver++ (2S) method to update the state tensor x.
5. Finally, if the next noise level is greater than zero, noise is added to the current state using the noise sampler.

The relationship of this function with its callees is significant, as it relies on several helper functions such as to_d, get_ancestral_step, and default_noise_sampler. The to_d function is used to convert the denoised output into a Karras ODE derivative, which is essential for updating the state tensor. The get_ancestral_step function calculates the appropriate noise levels for the sampling steps, ensuring that the process adheres to the desired stochastic behavior. The default_noise_sampler provides a mechanism to generate noise that matches the shape of the input tensor, facilitating the addition of randomness during the sampling process.

**Note**: It is crucial to ensure that the input tensor x and the noise levels (sigmas) are properly initialized and compatible in terms of dimensions. Users should also be aware of the impact of the eta parameter on the noise addition process, as it directly influences the sampling dynamics.

**Output Example**: An example output of the function could be a tensor representing the sampled state after processing through the model and applying the necessary updates, such as:
```python
sampled_output = sample_dpmpp_2s_ancestral(model, initial_tensor, noise_levels)
# This might return a tensor with the same shape as the input tensor, representing the final sampled state.

**Code Description**: The sample_dpmpp_sde function implements the DPM-Solver++ algorithm, which is a method for sampling from diffusion models. The function begins by determining the minimum and maximum noise levels from the provided sigmas. If a noise sampler is not provided, it initializes a BrownianTreeNoiseSampler with the input tensor and the determined noise levels. The function then prepares to iterate over the noise levels, denoising the input tensor at each step.

During each iteration, the model is called with the current input tensor and noise level, producing a denoised output. If a callback function is provided, it is invoked with the current state, allowing for monitoring or logging of the sampling process. Depending on the next noise level, the function either applies an Euler method or the DPM-Solver++ method to update the input tensor. The DPM-Solver++ method involves calculating intermediate noise levels and denoised outputs, which are used to refine the input tensor further.

The sample_dpmpp_sde function is called by the sample_dpmpp_sde_gpu function, which serves as a GPU-optimized wrapper for the same sampling process. This relationship allows for flexibility in executing the sampling on different hardware configurations while maintaining the core sampling logic.

**Note**: Users should ensure that the input tensor and noise levels are appropriately defined to avoid runtime errors. The choice of the eta parameter is crucial as it directly influences the sampling process's stochasticity. Additionally, the noise_sampler should be compatible with the input tensor's shape and device.

**Output Example**: A possible output of the function could be a tensor representing the sampled state after applying the DPM-Solver++ algorithm, such as:
```
tensor([[0.4567, -0.1234, 0.7890],
        [-0.2345, 0.6789, -0.9876]])

· disable: Optional boolean flag to disable progress tracking.

**Code Description**: The sample_dpmpp_2m function performs a series of denoising steps based on the DPM-Solver++ (2M) algorithm. It begins by initializing an input tensor `s_in` filled with ones, which matches the batch size of `x`. The function defines two lambda functions: `sigma_fn`, which computes the exponential of the negative input, and `t_fn`, which computes the negative logarithm of the input. 

The function then enters a loop that iterates over the range of noise levels defined in `sigmas`, excluding the last element. In each iteration, the model is called with the current input `x` and the corresponding noise level scaled by `s_in`. If a callback function is provided, it is invoked with the current state, including the input, iteration index, current sigma, and the denoised output.

The algorithm calculates the time variables `t` and `t_next` using the `t_fn` function, and the difference `h` between these two time values. Depending on whether `old_denoised` is None or the next sigma is zero, the function updates the input `x` using either the current denoised output or a combination of the current and previous denoised outputs. This process continues until all noise levels have been processed, resulting in a final output tensor that represents the denoised version of the input.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the model provided is compatible with the expected input and output shapes. The callback function, if used, should be designed to handle the data structure passed to it.

**Output Example**: A possible return value of the function could be a tensor of the same shape as the input `x`, representing the denoised data after processing through the DPM-Solver++ (2M) algorithm. For instance, if the input `x` is a tensor of shape (batch_size, channels, height, width), the output will also have the same shape, containing the denoised images.

The sample_ddpm function orchestrates the overall sampling process by invoking the DDPMSampler_step function, passing the necessary parameters, including the model, current state, and noise levels. This relationship highlights the role of DDPMSampler_step as a fundamental building block in the sampling mechanism of the diffusion model.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the noise_sampler function is properly defined and capable of handling the sigma and sigma_prev parameters, as this directly affects the output of the DDPMSampler_step function.

**Output Example**: A possible return value of the DDPMSampler_step function could be a tensor representing the updated state after applying the diffusion step, such as:
```
tensor([[0.5, 0.3],
        [0.2, 0.8]])
```
## FunctionDef generic_step_sampler(model, x, sigmas, extra_args, callback, disable, noise_sampler, step_function)
**generic_step_sampler**: The function of generic_step_sampler is to perform a series of sampling steps using a provided model and noise parameters.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· model: A callable model that takes an input tensor and a noise level to produce a denoised output.
· x: A tensor representing the initial input data to be processed through the sampling steps.
· sigmas: A list or tensor of noise levels that dictate the amount of noise to be applied at each step.
· extra_args: A dictionary of additional arguments to be passed to the model during denoising (default is None).

· noise_sampler: A function that generates noise based on the input tensor (default is None, in which case default_noise_sampler is used).
· step_function: A function that defines how to update the input tensor at each step of the sampling process.

**Code Description**: The generic_step_sampler function implements a sampling algorithm that iteratively refines an input tensor x using a model and a series of noise levels specified in sigmas. The function begins by initializing the noise sampler, which generates noise based on the shape of x if not provided. It then enters a loop that runs for each noise level in sigmas, excluding the last one.

During each iteration, the model is called with the current input x and the corresponding noise level, producing a denoised output. If a callback function is provided, it is invoked with the current state, including the input tensor, iteration index, current sigma, and the denoised result. The input tensor x is then updated using the specified step_function, which applies the denoised output and noise to refine x further. If the next noise level is not zero, x is scaled accordingly.

The generic_step_sampler function is called by other functions, such as sample_ddpm, which serves as a wrapper to facilitate the sampling process using the DDPM (Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models) approach. This relationship indicates that generic_step_sampler is a core component of the sampling framework, enabling various sampling strategies by providing a flexible interface for denoising and updating the input tensor.

**Note**: When using generic_step_sampler, ensure that the model and step_function are compatible with the expected input and output shapes. Additionally, the input tensor x should be properly initialized to achieve meaningful results during the sampling process.

**Output Example**: An example of the output from invoking generic_step_sampler could look like this:
```python
result = generic_step_sampler(model, torch.tensor([[0.5, 0.5], [0.5, 0.5]]), sigmas=[0.1, 0.2, 0.3])
# result would be a tensor that has been refined through the sampling steps based on the model and noise levels.
```

· model: A callable model that takes an input tensor and noise levels to produce a denoised output.
· x: A tensor representing the initial state in the diffusion process.
· sigmas: A list or tensor of noise levels that dictate the amount of noise to be applied at each step.

The sample_ddpm function passes the necessary parameters, including the model, the initial state (x), the noise levels (sigmas), and any additional arguments or callbacks that may be required during the sampling process.

The primary role of sample_ddpm is to facilitate the integration of the DDPMSampler_step function within the generic_step_sampler. By doing so, it ensures that the diffusion process is executed correctly, leveraging the DDPMSampler_step to compute the mean for the next state based on the current state and noise characteristics. This relationship highlights the sample_ddpm function as a crucial component in the overall sampling framework, enabling the application of diffusion models in a structured manner.

The sample_ddpm function is designed to be flexible, allowing users to customize the sampling process through the use of callbacks and additional arguments. This makes it suitable for various applications in generative modeling and denoising tasks.

**Note**: When using sample_ddpm, it is important to ensure that the model and noise_sampler functions are properly defined and compatible with the expected input and output shapes. Additionally, the input tensor x should be initialized appropriately to achieve meaningful results during the sampling process.

**Output Example**: A possible return value of the sample_ddpm function could be a tensor representing the updated state after applying the diffusion steps, such as:
```
tensor([[0.4, 0.6],
        [0.3, 0.7]])
```
## FunctionDef sample_lcm(model, x, sigmas, extra_args, callback, disable, noise_sampler)
**sample_lcm**: The function of sample_lcm is to perform sampling using a model and a series of noise levels, returning a denoised output based on the input tensor.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· model: A callable model that takes an input tensor and a noise level to produce a denoised output.
· x: A tensor that serves as the initial input for the sampling process.
· sigmas: A list or array of noise levels that dictate the sampling process at each step.
· extra_args: Optional additional arguments to be passed to the model during sampling.
· callback: An optional function that is called at each sampling step with the current state.
· disable: An optional boolean that, when set to True, disables the progress bar during sampling.
· noise_sampler: An optional function for generating noise; if not provided, a default noise sampler is used.

**Code Description**: The sample_lcm function implements a sampling algorithm that iteratively refines an input tensor x using a specified model and a series of noise levels (sigmas). Initially, it checks if extra_args and noise_sampler are provided; if not, it initializes them with default values. The function creates a tensor s_in filled with ones, which is used to scale the noise levels during the sampling process.

The main loop iterates over the range of noise levels, applying the model to the current tensor x and the current noise level scaled by s_in. After obtaining the denoised output, the function checks if a callback is provided and, if so, invokes it with the current state, including the input tensor, iteration index, current noise level, and the denoised output.

The denoised output then becomes the new input for the next iteration. If the next noise level is greater than zero, noise is added to the tensor x, generated by the noise_sampler function, which defaults to a noise generation mechanism based on the input tensor x if not explicitly provided.

This function is crucial in the context of diffusion models, where the goal is to progressively denoise a sample while incorporating stochastic elements through noise addition. The relationship with its callees, particularly the default_noise_sampler function, ensures that a consistent method for noise generation is utilized throughout the sampling process, enhancing the robustness and reliability of the sampling method.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the input tensor x is properly initialized and that the sigmas list is appropriately defined, as these directly influence the behavior and output of the sampling process.

**Output Example**: A possible output of the sample_lcm function could be a tensor that represents the final denoised output after processing through the specified number of noise levels, such as:
```python
output_tensor = sample_lcm(model, initial_tensor, [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4])
# output_tensor would be the denoised version of initial_tensor after applying the sampling process.
```
## FunctionDef sample_heunpp2(model, x, sigmas, extra_args, callback, disable, s_churn, s_tmin, s_tmax, s_noise)
**sample_heunpp2**: The function of sample_heunpp2 is to perform sampling using the Heun++ method for denoising in a diffusion model.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· parameter1: model - A callable object representing the denoising model that takes an input tensor and a noise level, returning a denoised output.  
· parameter2: x - A tensor representing the initial state or input to the denoising model.  
· parameter3: sigmas - A tensor containing the noise levels at each step of the sampling process.  
· parameter4: extra_args - An optional dictionary of additional arguments to pass to the model during denoising.

· parameter8: s_tmin - A float representing the minimum noise level for which to apply the churn.  
· parameter9: s_tmax - A float representing the maximum noise level for which to apply the churn.  
· parameter10: s_noise - A float representing the standard deviation of the noise to be added during the sampling process.

**Code Description**: The sample_heunpp2 function implements a sampling algorithm based on the Heun++ method, which is an enhancement of the Heun method for numerical integration. The function begins by initializing the necessary variables, including a tensor of ones for scaling and determining the end noise level from the provided sigmas. It then iterates over the noise levels, applying a series of calculations to update the input tensor x based on the denoising model's output and the noise levels.

During each iteration, the function calculates a gamma value that determines the amount of noise to introduce based on the current noise level and the specified churn parameters. It generates random noise and computes a modified noise level (sigma_hat) for the current step. The denoised output is obtained by passing the current tensor x and the modified noise level to the model. The function then computes the Karras ODE derivative using the to_d function, which normalizes the difference between the input tensor and the denoised output.

Depending on the position in the iteration and the noise levels, the function applies different numerical integration methods: Euler's method, Heun's method, or the Heun++ method. Each method updates the tensor x based on the computed derivatives and the time step determined by the difference in noise levels. The callback function, if provided, is called at each step to allow for external monitoring or logging of the sampling process.

The to_d function, which is called within sample_heunpp2, plays a crucial role in converting the denoised output into a Karras ODE derivative, ensuring that the sampling process adheres to the mathematical framework required for effective denoising.

**Note**: Users should ensure that the input tensor x and the sigma tensor are compatible in terms of dimensions to avoid runtime errors. Additionally, the behavior of the function is dependent on the proper functioning of the denoising model and the to_d function. Care should be taken when setting the churn parameters to achieve the desired sampling behavior.

**Output Example**: For an input tensor x with shape (3, 4) and a corresponding sigmas tensor of shape (5,), the output of sample_heunpp2 would be a tensor with shape (3, 4) representing the final denoised state after the sampling process has been completed.
## FunctionDef sample_tcd(model, x, sigmas, extra_args, callback, disable, noise_sampler, eta)
**sample_tcd**: The function of sample_tcd is to perform sampling using a given model and a series of noise levels (sigmas) to generate denoised outputs.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· model: An object representing the model used for generating samples. It is expected to have a method for denoising based on input data and noise levels.
· x: A tensor representing the initial input data from which samples will be generated.
· sigmas: A list or tensor of noise levels that will be used during the sampling process.
· extra_args: Optional additional arguments that can be passed to the model during the denoising process.
· callback: An optional function that can be called at each step of the sampling process to provide intermediate results.
· disable: A boolean flag to enable or disable progress tracking during the sampling process.
· noise_sampler: An optional function for generating noise. If not provided, a default noise sampler will be used.
· eta: A float value that controls the amount of noise added during the sampling process, with a default value of 0.3.

**Code Description**: The sample_tcd function implements a sampling algorithm that iteratively refines an input tensor x based on a series of noise levels specified in sigmas. Initially, it checks if extra_args and noise_sampler are provided; if not, it initializes them with default values. The function then prepares the necessary parameters for the sampling process, including calculating timesteps and cumulative products of alpha and beta values derived from the model's sampling properties.

In each iteration of the sampling loop, the model is called to predict a denoised version of the input tensor based on the current noise level. The difference between the original input and the denoised output is computed to estimate the noise, which is then used to update the denoised output. If a callback function is provided, it is invoked to report the current state of the sampling process.

The function also incorporates a mechanism to add noise to the denoised output based on the specified eta value and the current and next noise levels. This ensures that the sampling process can adaptively introduce noise when required. The final output is the refined tensor after all iterations, which represents the sampled data.

The sample_tcd function is related to other functions in the module that utilize noise sampling, such as sample_euler_ancestral and sample_dpm_2_ancestral. It relies on the default_noise_sampler function to create a noise generation mechanism if a custom noise_sampler is not provided. This relationship ensures that the sampling methods maintain consistency in noise generation, which is crucial for achieving reliable results in stochastic sampling processes.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the input tensor x is properly initialized and that the sigmas parameter contains appropriate noise levels for effective sampling. The callback function, if used, should be designed to handle the intermediate results appropriately.

**Output Example**: An example of the output from invoking the sample_tcd function could look like this:
```python
sampled_output = sample_tcd(model, initial_tensor, sigmas)
# sampled_output would be a tensor that has been refined through the sampling process, representing the generated samples.
```
## FunctionDef sample_restart(model, x, sigmas, extra_args, callback, disable, s_noise, restart_list)
**sample_restart**: The function of sample_restart is to implement restart sampling in generative processes to enhance the quality of generated samples.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· model: A callable model that takes input data and a noise level (sigma) to produce denoised outputs.
· x: A tensor representing the initial input data to be processed.
· sigmas: A tensor containing the noise levels to be used during the sampling process.
· extra_args: A dictionary of additional arguments to be passed to the model (default is None).
· callback: An optional callable that is invoked at each sampling step with the current state (default is None).
· disable: A boolean flag to disable progress tracking (default is None).
· s_noise: A float representing the scale of noise added during the sampling process (default is 1.0).
· restart_list: A dictionary specifying the restart parameters in the format {min_sigma: [restart_steps, restart_times, max_sigma]} (default is None).

**Code Description**: The sample_restart function is designed to facilitate a sampling process that incorporates restarts to improve the generative quality of outputs. The function begins by initializing necessary variables and determining the restart strategy based on the provided sigmas. If no restart_list is provided, the function automatically generates one based on the number of steps available in the sigmas tensor.

The core of the sampling process is managed through the heun_step function, which implements Heun's method (a second-order Runge-Kutta method) for numerical integration. This method is used to update the input tensor x based on the model's denoised output and the current noise levels. The function also allows for the addition of noise between steps to enhance diversity in the generated samples.

The function iterates through the defined steps, applying the Heun's method for each transition between noise levels. If a restart condition is met (as defined in the restart_list), additional sampling steps are inserted into the process, allowing the model to re-sample from a specified range of noise levels. This mechanism is crucial for improving the quality of the generated samples, especially in scenarios where the model may benefit from revisiting previous noise levels.

The sample_restart function calls the get_sigmas_karras function to generate the noise schedule, which is essential for determining the appropriate noise levels to use during the sampling process. This relationship highlights the importance of the noise schedule in guiding the sampling strategy and ensuring effective exploration of the generative space.

**Note**: When using sample_restart, it is important to ensure that the model and input data are correctly configured. Additionally, users should be aware of the implications of the restart_list on the sampling process, as it can significantly affect the output quality. Proper tuning of the s_noise parameter is also recommended to achieve the desired level of variability in the generated samples.

**Output Example**: If the function is called with a model that generates denoised outputs and appropriate input parameters, a possible return value could be a tensor representing the final generated samples, such as `tensor([[0.5, 0.2, 0.1], [0.6, 0.3, 0.4], ...])`, indicating the processed data after the sampling procedure.
### FunctionDef heun_step(x, old_sigma, new_sigma, second_order)
**heun_step**: The function of heun_step is to perform a single step of the Heun method (a second-order Runge-Kutta method) for updating the state of a tensor during the denoising process in a diffusion model.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· parameter1: x - A tensor representing the current state or input to the denoising model.  
· parameter2: old_sigma - A tensor representing the previous noise level associated with the input tensor x.  
· parameter3: new_sigma - A tensor representing the new noise level to be applied to the input tensor x.  
· parameter4: second_order - A boolean flag indicating whether to use the second-order method (Heun's method) or the first-order method (Euler's method). Default is True.

**Code Description**: The heun_step function is designed to update the state of a tensor x based on the denoising model's output and the specified noise levels. It begins by denoising the input tensor x using the model function, which takes the current state and the old noise level (scaled by s_in) as inputs. The output of the model is stored in the variable denoised.

Next, the function computes the derivative d by calling the to_d function, which converts the denoised output into a Karras ODE derivative. This derivative represents the direction in which the tensor x should be adjusted based on the denoised output.

If a callback function is provided, it is invoked with the current state, step ID, new sigma, old sigma, and the denoised output. This allows for external monitoring or logging of the denoising process.

The function then calculates the time step dt as the difference between new_sigma and old_sigma. If new_sigma is zero or if the second_order flag is set to False, the function employs the Euler method for the update, which is a first-order approximation. In this case, the tensor x is updated directly by adding the product of the derivative d and the time step dt.

If the second_order flag is True, the function uses Heun's method, which is a more accurate second-order method. It first computes an intermediate state x_2 by applying the derivative d to the current state x. The model is then called again with this intermediate state and the new noise level to obtain a new denoised output denoised_2. The derivative d_2 is computed using the to_d function for this new state. The average of the two derivatives (d and d_2) is calculated to obtain d_prime, which is then used to update the tensor x.

Finally, the step_id is incremented to keep track of the number of steps taken, and the updated tensor x is returned.

The heun_step function relies on the to_d function to compute the necessary derivatives for updating the tensor state. This relationship is crucial, as the accuracy of the Heun method depends on the correct computation of these derivatives.

**Note**: Users should ensure that the input tensor x and the sigma tensors are compatible in terms of dimensions to avoid runtime errors. Additionally, the behavior of the function is contingent upon the proper functioning of the model and the to_d function, particularly in handling the denoising process accurately.

**Output Example**: For an input tensor x with shape (3, 4), an old_sigma tensor of shape (3, 1), a new_sigma tensor of shape (3, 1), and assuming the model returns a denoised tensor of the same shape, the output of heun_step would be an updated tensor x with shape (3, 4) reflecting the new state after applying the Heun method.
